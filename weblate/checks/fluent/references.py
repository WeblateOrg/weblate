class FluentReferencesCheck(TargetCheck):
    r"""
    Check that the target uses the same Fluent references as the source.

    A Fluent Message or Term can reference another Message, Term, Attribute, or
    a variable. For example:

    | Here is a { message }, a { message.attribute } a { -term } and a { $variable }.
    | Within a function { NUMBER($num, minimumFractionDigits: 2) }

    Generally, translated Messages or Terms are expected to contain the same
    references as the source, although not necessarily in the same order of
    appearance. So this check ensures that translations use the same references
    in their value as the source value, the same number of times, and with no
    additions. For Messages, this will also check that each Attribute in the
    translation uses the same references as the matching Attribute in the
    source.

    When the source or translation contains Fluent Select Expressions, then each
    possible variant in the source must be matched with at least one variant in
    the translation with the same references, and vice versa.

    Moreover, if a variable reference appears both in the Select Expression's
    selector and within one of its variants, then all variants may also be
    considered as if they also contain that reference. The assumption being that
    the variant's key may have made the reference redundant for that variant.
    For example:

    | { $num ->
    |     [one] an apple
    |    *[other] { $num } apples
    | }

    Here, for the purposes of this check, the ``[one]`` variant will also be
    considered to contain the ``$num`` reference.

    However, a reference within the Select Expression's selector, which can only
    be a variable of a Term Attribute in Fluent's syntax, will not by itself
    count as a required reference because they do not form the actual text
    content of the string that the end-user will see, and the presence of a
    Select Expression is considered locale-specific. For example:

    | { -term.starts-with-vowel ->
    |     [yes] an { -term }
    |    *[no] a { -term }
    | }

    Here a reference to ``-term.starts-with-vowel`` is not expected to appear in
    translations, but a reference to ``-term`` is.
