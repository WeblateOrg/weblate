    We hook into merge and overwrite plural with each merge. As Weblate locales

    When loading locales, Django uses it's own plural forms for all
    localizations. This can break plurals for other applications as they can
    have different plural form. We don't use much of Django messages in the UI
    (with exception of the admin interface), so it's better to possibly break
    Django translations rather than breaking our own ones.
