# With Gettext PO files, you might get bit by conflicts in PO file
# headers. To avoid it, you can use the this merge driver. Use it by
# putting the following configuration in your .gitconfig:
#
#  [merge "merge-gettext-po"]
#     name = merge driver for Gettext PO files
#     driver = /path/to/weblate/examples/git-merge-gettext-po %O %A %B
#
# Then enable its use by defining proper attributes in the given repository (e.g. in
# .git/info/attributes:
#
#    *.po merge=merge-gettext-po
#
# This merge driver assumes changes in POT files always are done in the
# attemptedly merged branch.
#
# This merge driver is now automatically installed for all Weblate internal
# repositories.

# Usage: git-merge-gettext-po %O %A %B
# First param is merge ancestors version
# Second param is current version
# Third param is other branches' version
 
REGX='^"POT-Creation-Date:.*'

# Grab date from other branch
REPL=`grep "$REGX" "$3" | sed -e 's/\\\\/\\\\\\\\/'`
 
# Push it into other files
sed -i -e "s/$REGX/$REPL/" "$2"
sed -i -e "s/$REGX/$REPL/" "$1"

# Do merge on these changed files
git merge-file -L "" -L "" -L "" "$2" "$1" "$3"
