Building the translation community
==================================

Weblate provides you content to share on your website or other channels to
promote your translation project. A nice welcome page called Engage is available to attract
new contributors and provide them basic information about the translation. Additionally, you can
share information about the efforts using social networks. All these
possibilities can be found on the :guilabel:`Community` tab:

All these badges are provided with a link to simple page which explains users
how to translate using Weblate:
