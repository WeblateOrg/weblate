Promoting the translation
=========================

Weblate provides you widgets to share on your website or other sources to
promote the translation project. It also has a nice welcome page for new contributors
to give them basic information about the translation. Additionally you can
share information about translation using Facebook or Twitter. All these
possibilities can be found on the :guilabel:`Share` tab. Example of status badges
for Weblate itself are show below.
