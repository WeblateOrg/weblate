Glossary
========

Each project can have an assigned glossary for any language as a shorthand for storing
terminology. Consistency is more easily maintained this way.
Terms from the glossary containing words from the currently translated string can be
displayed in the sidebar.

Managing glossaries
-------------------

.. versionchanged:: 4.5

   Glossaries are now regular translation components and you can use all
   Weblate features on them - commenting, storing in a Git repository, or
   adding explanations.

You can use any component as a glossary by turning on :ref:`component-is_glossary`.

An empty glossary for a given project is automatically created with the project.
Glossaries are shared among all components of the same project, and optionally
with other projects using :ref:`component-links`.

Glossary terms
--------------

The glossary terms are translated in a same way as regular strings. You can
toggle additional features using the :guilabel:`Tools` menu on each term.

Not translatable terms
++++++++++++++++++++++

.. versionadded:: 4.5

Glossary terms which are read-only are not meant to be translated. You can use
this for names or other terms which should not change while translating. Such
term is visually highlighted in the glossary sidebar.

The terms can be flagged on the source language using :guilabel:`Tools` ↓
:guilabel:`Prohibit translations`. In the background this toggles the ``read-only``
flag on the string.

   :ref:`custom-checks`

.. _glossary-forbidden:

Forbidden translations
++++++++++++++++++++++

.. versionadded:: 4.5

You can flag certain glossary terms as forbidden - those should not be used
while translating. Use this to clarify translation when some words are
ambiguous or could have unexpected meanings.

The terms can be flagged on the source language using :guilabel:`Tools` ↓
:guilabel:`Mark as forbidden translations`. In the background this toggles the ``forbidden``
flag on the string.

.. _glossary-terminology:

Terminology
+++++++++++

.. versionadded:: 4.5

You can flag certain glossary terms as terminology - those  will be present in
all glossary languages. Use this to flag important terms which should be
translated consistently.

The terms can be flagged on the source language using :guilabel:`Tools` ↓
:guilabel:`Mark as terminology`. In the background this toggles the
``terminology`` flag on the string.
