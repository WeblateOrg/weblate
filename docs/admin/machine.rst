Machine translation
===================

.. _machine-translation-setup:

Machine translation setup
-------------------------

Weblate has builtin support for several machine translation services and it's
up to administrator to enable them. The services have different terms of use, so
please check whether you are allowed to use them before enabling in Weblate.
The individual services are enabled using :setting:`MACHINE_TRANSLATION_SERVICES`.

The source language can be configured at :ref:`project`.

Amagama
+++++++

Special installation of :ref:`tmserver` run by Virtaal authors.

To enable this service, add ``trans.machine.tmserver.AmagamaTranslation`` to
:setting:`MACHINE_TRANSLATION_SERVICES`.

    `Glosbe website <https://glosbe.com/>`_

.. _google-translate:

Google Translate

This service uses Translation API and you need to obtain API key and enable
billing on Google API console.

To enable this service, add ``trans.machine.google.GoogleTranslation`` to
:setting:`MACHINE_TRANSLATION_SERVICES`.

.. seealso::

    :setting:`MT_GOOGLE_KEY`,
    `Google translate documentation <https://cloud.google.com/translate/docs>`_

.. _ms-translate:

Bing Translator
+++++++++++++++

Machine translation service provided by Microsoft, it's known as Microsoft Translator as well.

You need to register at Azure market and use Client ID and secret from there.

To enable this service, add ``trans.machine.microsoft.MicrosoftTranslation`` to
:setting:`MACHINE_TRANSLATION_SERVICES`.

.. seealso::

    :setting:`MT_MICROSOFT_ID`, :setting:`MT_MICROSOFT_SECRET`,
    `Bing Translator <http://www.bing.com/translator/>`_,
    `Azure datamarket <https://datamarket.azure.com/developer/applications/>`_

.. _mymemory:

MyMemory
++++++++

Huge translation memory with machine translation.

Free, anonymous usage is currently limited to 100 requests/day, or to 1000
requests/day when you provide contact email in :setting:`MT_MYMEMORY_EMAIL`.
you can also ask them for more.

To enable this service, add ``trans.machine.mymemory.MyMemoryTranslation`` to
:setting:`MACHINE_TRANSLATION_SERVICES`.

.. seealso::

    :setting:`MT_MYMEMORY_EMAIL`,
    :setting:`MT_MYMEMORY_USER`,
    :setting:`MT_MYMEMORY_KEY`,
    `MyMemory website <http://mymemory.translated.net/>`_

.. _tmserver:

tmserver
++++++++

You can run your own translation memory server which is bundled with
Translate-toolkit and let Weblate talk to it. You can also use it with
amaGama server, which is enhanced version of tmserver.

First you will want to import some data to the translation memory:

To enable this service, add ``trans.machine.tmserver.TMServerTranslation`` to
:setting:`MACHINE_TRANSLATION_SERVICES`.

.. code-block:: sh

    build_tmdb -d /var/lib/tm/db -s en -t cs locale/cs/LC_MESSAGES/django.po
    build_tmdb -d /var/lib/tm/db -s en -t de locale/de/LC_MESSAGES/django.po
    build_tmdb -d /var/lib/tm/db -s en -t fr locale/fr/LC_MESSAGES/django.po

Now you can start tmserver to listen to your requests:

.. code-block:: sh

    tmserver -d /var/lib/tm/db

And configure Weblate to talk to it:

.. code-block:: python

    MT_TMSERVER = 'http://localhost:8888/'

.. seealso::

    :setting:`MT_TMSERVER`,
    `tmserver, a Translation Memory service <http://docs.translatehouse.org/projects/translate-toolkit/en/latest/commands/tmserver.html>`_,
    `Amagama Translation Memory <http://amagama.translatehouse.org/>`_

Weblate
+++++++

Weblate can be source of machine translation as well. There are two services to
provide you results - one does exact search for string, the other one finds all
similar strings.

First one is useful for full string translations, the second one for finding
individual phrases or words to keep the translation consistent.

To enable these services, add
``trans.machine.weblatetm.WeblateSimilarTranslation`` (for similar string
matching) and/or ``trans.machine.weblatetm.WeblateTranslation`` (for exact
string matching) to :setting:`MACHINE_TRANSLATION_SERVICES`.

.. note::

    For similarity matching, it is recommended to have Whoosh 2.5.2 or later,
    earlier versions can cause infinite looks under some occasions.

Custom machine translation
--------------------------

You can also implement own machine translation services using few lines of
Python code. Following example implements translation to fixed list of
languages using ``dictionary`` Python module:

.. literalinclude:: ../../examples/mt_service.py
    :language: python

You can list own class in :setting:`MACHINE_TRANSLATION_SERVICES` and Weblate
will start using that.
