.. _requirements:

Software requirements
---------------------

Operating system
++++++++++++++++

Weblate is known to work on Linux, FreeBSD and macOS. Other Unix like systems
will most likely work too.

Weblate is not supported on Windows. But it may still work and patches are
happily accepted.

Other services
++++++++++++++

Weblate is using other services for its operation. You will need at least
following services running:

* PostgreSQL database server, see :ref:`database-setup`.
* Redis server for cache and tasks queue, see :ref:`celery`.
* SMTP server for outgoing e-mail, see :ref:`out-mail`.

.. _python-deps:

      pip install "Weblate[all]"

   Or you can install Weblate without any optional features:

   .. code-block:: sh

      pip install Weblate

Database backend dependencies
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Weblate supports PostgreSQL, MySQL and MariaDB, see :ref:`database-setup` and
backends documentation for more details.

Other system requirements
+++++++++++++++++++++++++

The following dependencies have to be installed on the system:

``Git``
    https://git-scm.com/
Pango, Cairo and related header files and gir introspection data
    https://cairographics.org/, https://pango.gnome.org/, see :ref:`pangocairo`

    https://github.com/licensee/licensee

Build-time dependencies
+++++++++++++++++++++++

To build some of the :ref:`python-deps` you might need to install their
dependencies. This depends on how you install them, so please consult
individual packages for documentation. You won't need those if using prebuilt
``Wheels`` while installing using ``pip`` or when you use distribution packages.

.. _pangocairo:

Pango and Cairo
+++++++++++++++

.. versionchanged:: 3.7

Weblate uses Pango and Cairo for rendering bitmap widgets (see
:ref:`promotion`) and rendering checks (see :ref:`fonts`). To properly install
Python bindings for those you need to install system libraries first - you need
both Cairo and Pango, which in turn need GLib. All those should be installed
with development files and GObject introspection data.

.. _verify:

Verifying release signatures
----------------------------

Weblate release are cryptographically signed by the releasing developer.
Currently this is Michal Čihař. Fingerprint of his PGP key is:

.. code-block:: console

    63CB 1DF1 EF12 CF2A C0EE 5A32 9C27 B313 42B7 511D

and you can get more identification information from <https://keybase.io/nijel>.

You should verify that the signature matches the archive you have downloaded.
This way you can be sure that you are using the same code that was released.
You should also verify the date of the signature to make sure that you
downloaded the latest version.

Each archive is accompanied with ``.asc`` files which contain the PGP signature
for it. Once you have both of them in the same folder, you can verify the signature:

.. code-block:: console

   $ gpg --verify Weblate-3.5.tar.xz.asc
   gpg: assuming signed data in 'Weblate-3.5.tar.xz'
   gpg: Signature made Ne 3. března 2019, 16:43:15 CET
   gpg:                using RSA key 87E673AF83F6C3A0C344C8C3F4AA229D4D58C245
   gpg: Can't check signature: public key not found

As you can see GPG complains that it does not know the public key. At this
point you should do one of the following steps:

* Use `wkd` to download the key:

.. code-block:: console

   $ gpg --auto-key-locate wkd --locate-keys michal@cihar.com
   pub   rsa4096 2009-06-17 [SC]
         63CB1DF1EF12CF2AC0EE5A329C27B31342B7511D
   uid           [ultimate] Michal Čihař <michal@cihar.com>
   uid           [ultimate] Michal Čihař <nijel@debian.org>
   uid           [ultimate] [jpeg image of size 8848]
   uid           [ultimate] Michal Čihař (Braiins) <michal.cihar@braiins.cz>
   sub   rsa4096 2009-06-17 [E]
   sub   rsa4096 2015-09-09 [S]


* Download the keyring from `Michal's server <https://cihar.com/.well-known/openpgpkey/hu/wmxth3chu9jfxdxywj1skpmhsj311mzm>`_, then import it with:

.. code-block:: console

   $ gpg --import wmxth3chu9jfxdxywj1skpmhsj311mzm

* Download and import the key from one of the key servers:

.. code-block:: console

   $ gpg --keyserver hkp://pgp.mit.edu --recv-keys 87E673AF83F6C3A0C344C8C3F4AA229D4D58C245
   gpg: key 9C27B31342B7511D: "Michal Čihař <michal@cihar.com>" imported
   gpg: Total number processed: 1
   gpg:              unchanged: 1

This will improve the situation a bit - at this point you can verify that the
signature from the given key is correct but you still can not trust the name used
in the key:

.. code-block:: console

   $ gpg --verify Weblate-3.5.tar.xz.asc
   gpg: assuming signed data in 'Weblate-3.5.tar.xz'
   gpg: Signature made Ne 3. března 2019, 16:43:15 CET
   gpg:                using RSA key 87E673AF83F6C3A0C344C8C3F4AA229D4D58C245
   gpg: Good signature from "Michal Čihař <michal@cihar.com>" [ultimate]
   gpg:                 aka "Michal Čihař <nijel@debian.org>" [ultimate]
   gpg:                 aka "[jpeg image of size 8848]" [ultimate]
   gpg:                 aka "Michal Čihař (Braiins) <michal.cihar@braiins.cz>" [ultimate]
   gpg: WARNING: This key is not certified with a trusted signature!
   gpg:          There is no indication that the signature belongs to the owner.
   Primary key fingerprint: 63CB 1DF1 EF12 CF2A C0EE  5A32 9C27 B313 42B7 511D

The problem here is that anybody could issue the key with this name.  You need to
ensure that the key is actually owned by the mentioned person.  The GNU Privacy
Handbook covers this topic in the chapter `Validating other keys on your public
keyring`_. The most reliable method is to meet the developer in person and
exchange key fingerprints, however you can also rely on the web of trust. This way
you can trust the key transitively through signatures of others, who have met
the developer in person.

Once the key is trusted, the warning will not occur:

.. code-block:: console

   $ gpg --verify Weblate-3.5.tar.xz.asc
   gpg: assuming signed data in 'Weblate-3.5.tar.xz'
   gpg: Signature made Sun Mar  3 16:43:15 2019 CET
   gpg:                using RSA key 87E673AF83F6C3A0C344C8C3F4AA229D4D58C245
   gpg: Good signature from "Michal Čihař <michal@cihar.com>" [ultimate]
   gpg:                 aka "Michal Čihař <nijel@debian.org>" [ultimate]
   gpg:                 aka "[jpeg image of size 8848]" [ultimate]
   gpg:                 aka "Michal Čihař (Braiins) <michal.cihar@braiins.cz>" [ultimate]


Should the signature be invalid (the archive has been changed), you would get a
clear error regardless of the fact that the key is trusted or not:

.. code-block:: console

   $ gpg --verify Weblate-3.5.tar.xz.asc
   gpg: Signature made Sun Mar  3 16:43:15 2019 CET
   gpg:                using RSA key 87E673AF83F6C3A0C344C8C3F4AA229D4D58C245
   gpg: BAD signature from "Michal Čihař <michal@cihar.com>" [ultimate]

.. _file-permissions:

Filesystem permissions
----------------------

The Weblate process needs to be able to read and write to the directory where
it keeps data - :setting:`DATA_DIR`. All files within this directory should be
owned and writable by the user running all Weblate processes (typically WSGI and Celery, see :ref:`server` and :ref:`celery`).

The default configuration places them in the same tree as the Weblate sources, however
you might prefer to move these to a better location such as:
:file:`/var/lib/weblate`.

Weblate tries to create these directories automatically, but it will fail
when it does not have permissions to do so.

You should also take care when running :ref:`manage`, as they should be ran
under the same user as Weblate itself is running, otherwise permissions on some
files might be wrong.

In the Docker container, all files in the :file:`/app/data` volume have to be
owned by the ``weblate`` user inside the container (UID 1000).

.. seealso::

   :ref:`static-files`

.. _database-setup:

Database setup for Weblate
--------------------------

It is recommended to run Weblate with a PostgreSQL database server.

.. seealso::

   :ref:`production-database`,
   :doc:`django:ref/databases`,
   :ref:`database-migration`

.. _postgresql:

PostgreSQL
++++++++++

PostgreSQL is usually the best choice for Django-based sites. It's the reference
database used for implementing Django database layer.

.. note::

   Weblate uses trigram extension which has to be installed separately in some
   cases. Look for ``postgresql-contrib`` or a similarly named package.

.. seealso::

    :ref:`django:postgresql-notes`

.. _dbsetup-postgres:

Creating a database in PostgreSQL
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

It is usually a good idea to run Weblate in a separate database, and separate user account:

.. code-block:: sh

    # If PostgreSQL was not installed before, set the main password
    sudo -u postgres psql postgres -c "\password postgres"

    # Create a database user called "weblate"
    sudo -u postgres createuser --superuser --pwprompt weblate

    # Create the database "weblate" owned by "weblate"
    sudo -u postgres createdb -E UTF8 -O weblate weblate

.. hint::

   If you don't want to make the Weblate user a superuser in PostgreSQL, you can
   omit that. In that case you will have to perform some of the migration steps
   manually as a PostgreSQL superuser in schema Weblate will use:

   .. code-block:: postgres

        CREATE EXTENSION IF NOT EXISTS pg_trgm WITH SCHEMA weblate;

.. _config-postgresql:

Configuring Weblate to use PostgreSQL
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The :file:`settings.py` snippet for PostgreSQL:

.. code-block:: python

    DATABASES = {
        "default": {
            # Database engine
            "ENGINE": "django.db.backends.postgresql",
            # Database name
            "NAME": "weblate",
            # Database user
            "USER": "weblate",
            # Name of role to alter to set parameters in PostgreSQL,
            # use in case role name is different than user used for authentication.
            # "ALTER_ROLE": "weblate",
            # Database password
            "PASSWORD": "password",
            # Set to empty string for localhost
            "HOST": "database.example.com",
            # Set to empty string for default
            "PORT": "",
        }
    }

The database migration performs `ALTER ROLE
<https://www.postgresql.org/docs/12/sql-alterrole.html>`_ on database role used
by Weblate. In most cases the name of the role matches username. In more
complex setups the role name is different than username and you will get error
about non-existing role during the database migration
(``psycopg2.errors.UndefinedObject: role "weblate@hostname" does not exist``).
This is known to happen with Azure Database for PostgreSQL, but it's not
limited to this environment. Please set ``ALTER_ROLE`` to change name of the
role Weblate should alter during the database migration.

.. _mysql:

MySQL and MariaDB
+++++++++++++++++

.. hint::

    Some Weblate features will perform better with :ref:`postgresql`. This
    includes searching and translation memory, which both utilize full-text
    features in the database and PostgreSQL implementation is superior.

Weblate can be also used with MySQL or MariaDB, please see
:ref:`django:mysql-notes` and :ref:`django:mariadb-notes` for caveats using
Django with those. Because of the limitations it is recommended to use
:ref:`postgresql` for new installations.

Weblate requires MySQL at least 5.7.8 or MariaDB at least 10.2.7.

Following configuration is recommended for Weblate:

* Use the ``utf8mb4`` charset to allow representation of higher Unicode planes (for example emojis).
* Configure the server with ``innodb_large_prefix`` to allow longer indices on text fields.
* Set the isolation level to ``READ COMMITTED``.
* The SQL mode should be set to ``STRICT_TRANS_TABLES``.

MySQL 8.x, MariaDB 10.5.x or newer have reasonable default configuration so
that no server tweaking should be necessary and all what is needed can be
configured on the client side.

Below is an example :file:`/etc/my.cnf.d/server.cnf` for a server with 8 GB of
RAM. These settings should be sufficient for most installs. MySQL and MariaDB
have tunables that will increase the performance of your server that are
considered not necessary unless you are planning on having large numbers of
concurrent users accessing the system. See the various vendors documentation on
those details.

It is absolutely critical to reduce issues when installing that the setting
``innodb_file_per_table`` is set properly and MySQL/MariaDB restarted before
you start your Weblate install.

.. code-block:: ini

   [mysqld]
   character-set-server = utf8mb4
   character-set-client = utf8mb4
   collation-server = utf8mb4_unicode_ci

   datadir=/var/lib/mysql

   log-error=/var/log/mariadb/mariadb.log

   innodb_large_prefix=1
   innodb_file_format=Barracuda
   innodb_file_per_table=1
   innodb_buffer_pool_size=2G
   sql_mode=STRICT_TRANS_TABLES

.. hint::

   In case you are getting ``#1071 - Specified key was too long; max key length
   is 767 bytes`` error, please update your configuration to include the ``innodb``
   settings above and restart your install.

.. hint::

   In case you are getting ``#2006 - MySQL server has gone away`` error,
   configuring :setting:`django:CONN_MAX_AGE` might help.

Configuring Weblate to use MySQL/MariaDB
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The :file:`settings.py` snippet for MySQL and MariaDB:

.. code-block:: python

    DATABASES = {
        "default": {
            # Database engine
            "ENGINE": "django.db.backends.mysql",
            # Database name
            "NAME": "weblate",
            # Database user
            "USER": "weblate",
            # Database password
            "PASSWORD": "password",
            # Set to empty string for localhost
            "HOST": "127.0.0.1",
            # Set to empty string for default
            "PORT": "3306",
            # In case you wish to use additional
            # connection options
            "OPTIONS": {},
        }
    }

You should also create the ``weblate`` user account in MySQL or MariaDB before
you begin the install. Use the commands below to achieve that:

.. code-block:: sh

   GRANT ALL ON weblate.* to 'weblate'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'password';
   FLUSH PRIVILEGES;

Other configurations
--------------------

.. _out-mail:

Configuring outgoing e-mail
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Weblate sends out e-mails on various occasions - for account activation and on
various notifications configured by users. For this it needs access to an SMTP
server.

The mail server setup is configured using these settings:
:setting:`django:EMAIL_HOST`, :setting:`django:EMAIL_HOST_PASSWORD`,
:setting:`django:EMAIL_USE_TLS`, :setting:`django:EMAIL_USE_SSL`,
:setting:`django:EMAIL_HOST_USER` and :setting:`django:EMAIL_PORT`. Their
names are quite self-explanatory, but you can find more info in the
Django documentation.

.. hint::

    In case you get error about not supported authentication (for example
    ``SMTP AUTH extension not supported by server``), it is most likely caused
    by using insecure connection and server refuses to authenticate this way.
    Try enabling :setting:`django:EMAIL_USE_TLS` in such case.

.. seealso::

   :ref:`debug-mails`,
   :ref:`Configuring outgoing e-mail in Docker container <docker-mail>`

.. _reverse-proxy:

Running behind reverse proxy
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Several features in Weblate rely on being able to get client IP address. This
includes :ref:`rate-limit`, :ref:`spam-protection` or :ref:`audit-log`.

In default configuration Weblate parses IP address from ``REMOTE_ADDR`` which
is set by the WSGI handler.

In case you are running a reverse proxy, this field will most likely contain
its address. You need to configure Weblate to trust additional HTTP headers and
parse the IP address from these. This can not be enabled by default as it would
allow IP address spoofing for installations not using a reverse proxy. Enabling
:setting:`IP_BEHIND_REVERSE_PROXY` might be enough for the most usual setups,
but you might need to adjust :setting:`IP_PROXY_HEADER` and
:setting:`IP_PROXY_OFFSET` as well.

Another thing to take care of is the :http:header:`Host` header. It should match
to whatever is configured as :setting:`SITE_DOMAIN`. Additional configuration
might be needed in your reverse proxy (for example use ``ProxyPreserveHost On``
for Apache or ``proxy_set_header Host $host;`` with nginx).

.. seealso::

    :ref:`spam-protection`,
    :ref:`rate-limit`,
    :ref:`audit-log`,
    :setting:`IP_BEHIND_REVERSE_PROXY`,
    :setting:`IP_PROXY_HEADER`,
    :setting:`IP_PROXY_OFFSET`,
    :setting:`django:SECURE_PROXY_SSL_HEADER`

HTTP proxy
++++++++++

Weblate does execute VCS commands and those accept proxy configuration from
environment. The recommended approach is to define proxy settings in
:file:`settings.py`:

.. code-block:: python

   import os

   os.environ["http_proxy"] = "http://proxy.example.com:8080"
   os.environ["HTTPS_PROXY"] = "http://proxy.example.com:8080"

.. seealso::

   `Proxy Environment Variables <https://everything.curl.dev/usingcurl/proxies/env>`_

.. _configuration:

Adjusting configuration
-----------------------

.. seealso::

   :ref:`sample-configuration`

Copy :file:`weblate/settings_example.py` to :file:`weblate/settings.py` and
adjust it to match your setup. You will probably want to adjust the following
options:

.. setting:: ADMINS

``ADMINS``

    List of site administrators to receive notifications when something goes
    wrong, for example notifications on failed merges, or Django errors.

    .. seealso::

        :setting:`django:ADMINS`,
        :ref:`production-admins`

.. setting:: ALLOWED_HOSTS

``ALLOWED_HOSTS``

    You need to set this to list the hosts your site is supposed to serve. For
    example:

    .. code-block:: python

        ALLOWED_HOSTS = ["demo.weblate.org"]

    Alternatively you can include wildcard:

    .. code-block:: python

        ALLOWED_HOSTS = ["*"]

    .. seealso::

        :setting:`django:ALLOWED_HOSTS`,
        :envvar:`WEBLATE_ALLOWED_HOSTS`,
        :ref:`production-hosts`

.. setting:: SESSION_ENGINE

``SESSION_ENGINE``

    Configure how your sessions will be stored. In case you keep the default
    database backend engine, you should schedule:
    :command:`weblate clearsessions` to remove stale session data from the
    database.

    If you are using Redis as cache (see :ref:`production-cache`) it is
    recommended to use it for sessions as well:

    .. code-block:: python

         SESSION_ENGINE = "django.contrib.sessions.backends.cache"

    .. seealso::

        :ref:`django:configuring-sessions`,
        :setting:`django:SESSION_ENGINE`

.. setting:: DATABASES

``DATABASES``

    Connectivity to database server, please check Django's documentation for more
    details.

    .. seealso::

        :ref:`database-setup`,
        :setting:`django:DATABASES`,
        :doc:`django:ref/databases`

.. setting:: DEBUG

``DEBUG``

    Disable this for any production server. With debug mode enabled, Django will
    show backtraces in case of error to users, when you disable it, errors will
    be sent per e-mail to ``ADMINS`` (see above).

    Debug mode also slows down Weblate, as Django stores much more info
    internally in this case.

    .. seealso::

        :setting:`django:DEBUG`,
        :ref:`production-debug`

.. setting:: DEFAULT_FROM_EMAIL

``DEFAULT_FROM_EMAIL``

    E-mail sender address for outgoing e-mail, for example registration e-mails.

    .. seealso::

        :setting:`django:DEFAULT_FROM_EMAIL`

.. setting:: SECRET_KEY

``SECRET_KEY``

    Key used by Django to sign some info in cookies, see
    :ref:`production-secret` for more info.

    .. seealso::

        :setting:`django:SECRET_KEY`

.. setting:: SERVER_EMAIL

``SERVER_EMAIL``

    E-mail used as sender address for sending e-mails to the administrator, for
    example notifications on failed merges.

    .. seealso::

        :setting:`django:SERVER_EMAIL`

.. _tables-setup:

Filling up the database
-----------------------

After your configuration is ready, you can run
:samp:`weblate migrate` to create the database structure. Now you should be
able to create translation projects using the admin interface.

In case you want to run an installation non interactively, you can use
:samp:`weblate migrate --noinput`, and then create an admin user using
:djadmin:`createadmin` command.

Once you are done, you should also check the :guilabel:`Performance report` in the
admin interface, which will give you hints of potential non optimal configuration on your
site.

.. seealso::

   :ref:`config`,
   :ref:`privileges`

.. _production:

Production setup
----------------

For a production setup you should carry out adjustments described in the following sections.
The most critical settings will trigger a warning, which is indicated by an
exclamation mark in the top bar if signed in as a superuser:

.. image:: /screenshots/admin-wrench.png

It is also recommended to inspect checks triggered by Django (though you might not
need to fix all of them):

.. code-block:: sh

    weblate check --deploy

You can also review the very same checklist from the :ref:`management-interface`.

.. seealso::

    :doc:`django:howto/deployment/checklist`

.. _production-debug:

Disable debug mode
++++++++++++++++++

Disable Django's debug mode (:setting:`DEBUG`) by:

.. code-block:: python

    DEBUG = False

With debug mode on, Django stores all executed queries and shows users backtraces
of errors, which is not desired in a production setup.

.. seealso::

   :ref:`configuration`

.. _production-admins:

Properly configure admins
+++++++++++++++++++++++++

Set the correct admin addresses to the :setting:`ADMINS` setting to defining who will receive
e-mails in case something goes wrong on the server, for example:

.. code-block:: python

    ADMINS = (("Your Name", "your_email@example.com"),)

.. seealso::

   :ref:`configuration`

.. _production-site:

Set correct site domain
+++++++++++++++++++++++

Adjust site name and domain in the admin interface, otherwise links in RSS or
registration e-mails will not work. This is configured using
:setting:`SITE_DOMAIN` which should contain site domain name.

.. versionchanged:: 4.2

   Prior to the 4.2 release the Django sites framework was used instead, please
   see :doc:`django:ref/contrib/sites`.

.. seealso::

   :ref:`production-hosts`,
   :ref:`production-ssl`
   :setting:`SITE_DOMAIN`,
   :envvar:`WEBLATE_SITE_DOMAIN`,
   :setting:`ENABLE_HTTPS`

.. _production-ssl:

Correctly configure HTTPS
+++++++++++++++++++++++++

It is strongly recommended to run Weblate using the encrypted HTTPS protocol.
After enabling it, you should set :setting:`ENABLE_HTTPS` in the settings:

.. code-block:: python

   ENABLE_HTTPS = True

.. hint::

    You might want to set up HSTS as well, see
    :ref:`django:security-recommendation-ssl` for more details.

.. seealso::

   :setting:`ENABLE_HTTPS`,
   :ref:`production-hosts`,
   :ref:`production-site`


Set properly SECURE_HSTS_SECONDS
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

If your site is served over SSL, you have to consider setting a value for :setting:`django:SECURE_HSTS_SECONDS`
in the :file:`settings.py` to enable HTTP Strict Transport Security.
By default it's set to 0 as shown below.

.. code-block:: python

   SECURE_HSTS_SECONDS = 0

If set to a non-zero integer value, the :class:`django:django.middleware.security.SecurityMiddleware`
sets the :ref:`django:http-strict-transport-security` header on all responses that do not already have it.

.. warning::

    Setting this incorrectly can irreversibly (for some time) break your site. Read the
    :ref:`django:http-strict-transport-security` documentation first.


.. _production-database:

Use a powerful database engine
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

* Please use PostgreSQL for a production environment, see :ref:`database-setup`
  for more info.
* Use adjacent location for running the database server, otherwise the networking
  performance or reliability might ruin your Weblate experience.
* Check the database server performance or tweak its configuration, for example
  using `PGTune <https://pgtune.leopard.in.ua/>`_.

.. seealso::

    :ref:`database-setup`,
    :ref:`database-migration`,
    :ref:`configuration`,
    :doc:`django:ref/databases`

.. _production-cache:

Enable caching
++++++++++++++

If possible, use Redis from Django by adjusting the ``CACHES`` configuration
variable, for example:

.. code-block:: python

    CACHES = {
        "default": {
            "BACKEND": "django_redis.cache.RedisCache",
            "LOCATION": "redis://127.0.0.1:6379/0",
            # If redis is running on same host as Weblate, you might
            # want to use unix sockets instead:
            # 'LOCATION': 'unix:///var/run/redis/redis.sock?db=0',
            "OPTIONS": {
                "CLIENT_CLASS": "django_redis.client.DefaultClient",
                "PARSER_CLASS": "redis.connection.HiredisParser",
            },
        }
    }

.. hint::

   In case you change Redis settings for the cache, you might need to adjust
   them for Celery as well, see :ref:`celery`.

.. seealso::

    :ref:`production-cache-avatar`,
    :doc:`django:topics/cache`

.. _production-cache-avatar:

Avatar caching
++++++++++++++

In addition to caching of Django, Weblate performs caching of avatars. It is
recommended to use a separate, file-backed cache for this purpose:

.. code-block:: python

    CACHES = {
        "default": {
            # Default caching backend setup, see above
            "BACKEND": "django_redis.cache.RedisCache",
            "LOCATION": "unix:///var/run/redis/redis.sock?db=0",
            "OPTIONS": {
                "CLIENT_CLASS": "django_redis.client.DefaultClient",
                "PARSER_CLASS": "redis.connection.HiredisParser",
            },
        },
        "avatar": {
            "BACKEND": "django.core.cache.backends.filebased.FileBasedCache",
            "LOCATION": os.path.join(DATA_DIR, "avatar-cache"),
            "TIMEOUT": 604800,
            "OPTIONS": {
                "MAX_ENTRIES": 1000,
            },
        },
    }

.. seealso::

    :setting:`ENABLE_AVATARS`,
    :setting:`AVATAR_URL_PREFIX`,
    :ref:`avatars`,
    :ref:`production-cache`,
    :doc:`django:topics/cache`

.. _production-email:

Configure e-mail sending
++++++++++++++++++++++++

Weblate needs to send out e-mails on several occasions, and these e-mails should
have a correct sender address, please configure :setting:`SERVER_EMAIL` and
:setting:`DEFAULT_FROM_EMAIL` to match your environment, for example:

.. code-block:: python

    SERVER_EMAIL = "admin@example.org"
    DEFAULT_FROM_EMAIL = "weblate@example.org"


.. note::

   To disable sending e-mails by Weblate set :setting:`django:EMAIL_BACKEND`
   to ``django.core.mail.backends.dummy.EmailBackend``.

   This will disable *all* e-mail delivery including registration or password
   reset e-mails.

.. seealso::

    :ref:`configuration`,
    :ref:`out-mail`,
    :std:setting:`django:EMAIL_BACKEND`,
    :std:setting:`django:DEFAULT_FROM_EMAIL`,
    :std:setting:`django:SERVER_EMAIL`


.. _production-hosts:

Allowed hosts setup
+++++++++++++++++++

Django requires :setting:`ALLOWED_HOSTS` to hold a list of domain names
your site is allowed to serve, leaving it empty will block any requests.

In case this is not configured to match your HTTP server, you will get errors
like :samp:`Invalid HTTP_HOST header: '1.1.1.1'. You may need to add '1.1.1.1'
to ALLOWED_HOSTS.`

.. hint::

   On Docker container, this is available as :envvar:`WEBLATE_ALLOWED_HOSTS`.

.. seealso::

    :setting:`ALLOWED_HOSTS`,
    :envvar:`WEBLATE_ALLOWED_HOSTS`,
    :ref:`production-site`

.. _production-secret:

Django secret key
+++++++++++++++++

The :setting:`SECRET_KEY` setting is used by Django to sign cookies, and you should
really generate your own value rather than using the one from the example setup.

You can generate a new key using :file:`weblate/examples/generate-secret-key` shipped
with Weblate.

.. seealso::

    :setting:`SECRET_KEY`

.. _production-home:

Home directory
++++++++++++++

.. versionchanged:: 2.1
   This is no longer required, Weblate now stores all its data in
   :setting:`DATA_DIR`.

The home directory for the user running Weblate should exist and be
writable by this user. This is especially needed if you want to use SSH to
access private repositories, but Git might need to access this directory as
well (depending on the Git version you use).

You can change the directory used by Weblate in :file:`settings.py`, for
example to set it to ``configuration`` directory under the Weblate tree:

.. code-block:: python

    os.environ["HOME"] = os.path.join(BASE_DIR, "configuration")

.. note::

    On Linux, and other UNIX like systems, the path to user's home directory is
    defined in :file:`/etc/passwd`. Many distributions default to a non-writable
    directory for users used for serving web content (such as ``apache``,
    ``www-data`` or ``wwwrun``), so you either have to run Weblate under
    a different user, or change this setting.

.. seealso::

   :ref:`vcs-repos`

.. _production-templates:

Template loading
++++++++++++++++

It is recommended to use a cached template loader for Django. It caches parsed
templates and avoids the need to do parsing with every single request. You can
configure it using the following snippet (the ``loaders`` setting is important here):

.. code-block:: python

    TEMPLATES = [
        {
            "BACKEND": "django.template.backends.django.DjangoTemplates",
            "DIRS": [
                os.path.join(BASE_DIR, "templates"),
            ],
            "OPTIONS": {
                "context_processors": [
                    "django.contrib.auth.context_processors.auth",
                    "django.template.context_processors.debug",
                    "django.template.context_processors.i18n",
                    "django.template.context_processors.request",
                    "django.template.context_processors.csrf",
                    "django.contrib.messages.context_processors.messages",
                    "weblate.trans.context_processors.weblate_context",
                ],
                "loaders": [
                    (
                        "django.template.loaders.cached.Loader",
                        [
                            "django.template.loaders.filesystem.Loader",
                            "django.template.loaders.app_directories.Loader",
                        ],
                    ),
                ],
            },
        },
    ]

.. seealso::

    :py:class:`django:django.template.loaders.cached.Loader`

.. _production-cron:

Running maintenance tasks
+++++++++++++++++++++++++

For optimal performance, it is good idea to run some maintenance tasks in the
background. This is now automatically done by :ref:`celery` and covers following tasks:

* Configuration health check (hourly).
* Committing pending changes (hourly), see :ref:`lazy-commit` and :djadmin:`commit_pending`.
* Updating component alerts (daily).
* Update remote branches (nightly), see :setting:`AUTO_UPDATE`.
* Translation memory backup to JSON (daily), see :djadmin:`dump_memory`.
* Fulltext and database maintenance tasks (daily and weekly tasks), see :djadmin:`cleanuptrans`.

.. versionchanged:: 3.2

   Since version 3.2, the default way of executing these tasks is using Celery
   and Weblate already comes with proper configuration, see :ref:`celery`.

.. _production-encoding:

System locales and encoding
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++

The system locales should be configured to UTF-8 capable ones. On most Linux
distributions this is the default setting. In case it is not the case on your
system, please change locales to UTF-8 variant.

For example by editing :file:`/etc/default/locale` and setting there
``LANG="C.UTF-8"``.

In some cases the individual services have separate configuration for locales.
This varies between distribution and web servers, so check documentation of
your web server packages for that.

Apache on Ubuntu uses :file:`/etc/apache2/envvars`:

.. code-block:: sh

    export LANG='en_US.UTF-8'
    export LC_ALL='en_US.UTF-8'

Apache on CentOS uses :file:`/etc/sysconfig/httpd` (or
:file:`/opt/rh/httpd24/root/etc/sysconfig/httpd`):

.. code-block:: sh

    LANG='en_US.UTF-8'

.. _production-certs:

Using custom certificate authority
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Weblate does verify SSL certificates during HTTP requests. In case you are
using custom certificate authority which is not trusted in default bundles, you
will have to add its certificate as trusted.

The preferred approach is to do this at system level, please check your distro
documentation for more details (for example on debian this can be done by
placing the CA certificate into :file:`/usr/local/share/ca-certificates/` and
running :command:`update-ca-certificates`).

Once this is done, system tools will trust the certificate and this includes
Git.

For Python code, you will need to configure requests to use system CA bundle
instead of the one shipped with it. This can be achieved by placing following
snippet to :file:`settings.py` (the path is Debian specific):

.. code-block:: python

    import os

    os.environ["REQUESTS_CA_BUNDLE"] = "/etc/ssl/certs/ca-certificates.crt"


.. _production-compress:

Compressing client assets
+++++++++++++++++++++++++

Weblate comes with a bunch of JavaScript and CSS files. For performance reasons
it is good to compress them before sending to a client. In default
configuration this is done on the fly at cost of little overhead. On big
installations, it is recommended to enable offline compression mode. This needs
to be done in the configuration and the compression has to be triggered on
every Weblate upgrade.

The configuration switch is simple by enabling
:attr:`compressor:django.conf.settings.COMPRESS_OFFLINE` and configuring
:attr:`compressor:django.conf.settings.COMPRESS_OFFLINE_CONTEXT` (the latter is
already included in the example configuration):

.. code-block:: python

    COMPRESS_OFFLINE = True

On each deploy you need to compress the files to match current version:

.. code-block:: sh

    weblate compress

.. hint::

   The official Docker image has this feature already enabled.

.. seealso::

   :ref:`compressor:scenarios`,
   :ref:`static-files`

.. _server:

Running server
--------------

.. hint::

   In case you are not experienced with services described below, you might want to try :doc:`install/docker`.

You will need several services to run Weblate, the recommended setup consists of:

* Database server (see :ref:`database-setup`)
* Cache server (see :ref:`production-cache`)
* Frontend web server for static files and SSL termination (see :ref:`static-files`)
* WSGI server for dynamic content (see :ref:`uwsgi`)
* Celery for executing background tasks (see :ref:`celery`)

.. note::

   There are some dependencies between the services, for example cache and
   database should be running when starting up Celery or uwsgi processes.

In most cases, you will run all services on single (virtual) server, but in
case your installation is heavy loaded, you can split up the services. The only
limitation on this is that Celery and Wsgi servers need access to
:setting:`DATA_DIR`.

.. note::

   The WSGI process has to be executed under the same user the Celery
   process, otherwise files in the :setting:`DATA_DIR` will be stored with
   mixed ownership, leading to runtime issues.

   See also :ref:`file-permissions` and :ref:`celery`.

Running web server
++++++++++++++++++

Running Weblate is not different from running any other Django based
program. Django is usually executed as uWSGI or fcgi (see examples for
different webservers below).

For testing purposes, you can use the built-in web server in Django:

.. code-block:: sh

    weblate runserver

.. warning::

    DO NOT USE THIS SERVER IN A PRODUCTION SETTING. It has not gone through
    security audits or performance tests. See also Django documentation on
    :djadmin:`django:runserver`.

.. hint::

   The Django built-in server serves static files only with :setting:`DEBUG`
   enabled as it is intended for development only. For production use, please
   see wsgi setups in :ref:`uwsgi`, :ref:`apache`, :ref:`apache-gunicorn`, and
   :ref:`static-files`.

.. _static-files:

Serving static files
++++++++++++++++++++

.. versionchanged:: 2.4

    Prior to version 2.4, Weblate didn't properly use the Django static files
    framework and the setup was more complex.

Django needs to collect its static files in a single directory. To do so,
execute :samp:`weblate collectstatic --noinput`. This will copy the static
files into a directory specified by the :setting:`django:STATIC_ROOT` setting (this defaults to
a ``static`` directory inside :setting:`DATA_DIR`).

It is recommended to serve static files directly from your web server, you should
use that for the following paths:

:file:`/static/`
    Serves static files for Weblate and the admin interface
    (from defined by ``STATIC_ROOT``).
:file:`/media/`
    Used for user media uploads (e.g. screenshots).
:file:`/favicon.ico`
    Should be rewritten to rewrite a rule to serve :file:`/static/favicon.ico`.

.. seealso::

   :ref:`uwsgi`,
   :ref:`apache`,
   :ref:`apache-gunicorn`,
   :ref:`production-compress`,
   :doc:`django:howto/deployment/index`,
   :doc:`django:howto/static-files/deployment`

.. _csp:

Content security policy
+++++++++++++++++++++++

The default Weblate configuration enables ``weblate.middleware.SecurityMiddleware``
middleware which sets security related HTTP headers like ``Content-Security-Policy``
or ``X-XSS-Protection``. These are by default set up to work with Weblate and its
configuration, but this might need customization for your environment.

.. seealso::

    :setting:`CSP_SCRIPT_SRC`,
    :setting:`CSP_IMG_SRC`,
    :setting:`CSP_CONNECT_SRC`,
    :setting:`CSP_STYLE_SRC`,
    :setting:`CSP_FONT_SRC`

.. _uwsgi:

Sample configuration for NGINX and uWSGI
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++


To run production webserver, use the wsgi wrapper installed with Weblate (in
virtual env case it is installed as
:file:`~/weblate-env/lib/python3.7/site-packages/weblate/wsgi.py`).  Don't
forget to set the Python search path to your virtualenv as well (for example
using ``virtualenv = /home/user/weblate-env`` in uWSGI).

The following configuration runs Weblate as uWSGI under the NGINX webserver.

Configuration for NGINX (also available as :file:`weblate/examples/weblate.nginx.conf`):

.. literalinclude:: ../../weblate/examples/weblate.nginx.conf
    :language: nginx

Configuration for uWSGI (also available as :file:`weblate/examples/weblate.uwsgi.ini`):

.. literalinclude:: ../../weblate/examples/weblate.uwsgi.ini
    :language: ini

.. seealso::

    :doc:`django:howto/deployment/wsgi/uwsgi`

.. _apache:

Sample configuration for Apache
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

It is recommended to use prefork MPM when using WSGI with Weblate.

The following configuration runs Weblate as WSGI, you need to have enabled
``mod_wsgi`` (available as :file:`weblate/examples/apache.conf`):

.. literalinclude:: ../../weblate/examples/apache.conf
    :language: apache

.. note::

    Weblate requires Python 3, so please make sure you are running Python 3
    variant of the modwsgi. Usually it is available as a separate package, for
    example ``libapache2-mod-wsgi-py3``.

.. seealso::

    :ref:`production-encoding`,
    :doc:`django:howto/deployment/wsgi/modwsgi`

.. _apache-gunicorn:

Sample configuration for Apache and Gunicorn
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

The following configuration runs Weblate in Gunicorn and Apache 2.4
(available as :file:`weblate/examples/apache.gunicorn.conf`):

.. literalinclude:: ../../weblate/examples/apache.gunicorn.conf
    :language: apache

.. seealso::

    :doc:`django:howto/deployment/wsgi/gunicorn`


Running Weblate under path
++++++++++++++++++++++++++

.. versionadded:: 1.3

It is recommended to use prefork MPM when using WSGI with Weblate.

A sample Apache configuration to serve Weblate under ``/weblate``. Again using
``mod_wsgi`` (also available as :file:`weblate/examples/apache-path.conf`):

.. literalinclude:: ../../weblate/examples/apache-path.conf
    :language: apache

Additionally, you will have to adjust :file:`weblate/settings.py`:

.. code-block:: python

    URL_PREFIX = "/weblate"

.. _celery:

Background tasks using Celery
-----------------------------

.. versionadded:: 3.2

Weblate uses Celery to execute regular and background tasks. You are supposed
to run a Celery service that will execute these. For example, it is responsible
for handling following operations (this list is not complete):

* Receiving webhooks from external services (see :ref:`hooks`).
* Running regular maintenance tasks such as backups, cleanups, daily add-ons, or updates
  (see :ref:`backup`, :setting:`BACKGROUND_TASKS`, :ref:`addons`).
* Running :ref:`auto-translation`.
* Sending digest notifications.
* Offloading expensive operations from the wsgi process.
* Committing pending changes (see :ref:`lazy-commit`).

A typical setup using Redis as a backend looks like this:

.. code-block:: python

   CELERY_TASK_ALWAYS_EAGER = False
   CELERY_BROKER_URL = "redis://localhost:6379"
   CELERY_RESULT_BACKEND = CELERY_BROKER_URL

.. seealso::

   :ref:`Redis broker configuration in Celery <celery:broker-redis-configuration>`

You should also start the Celery worker to process the tasks and start
scheduled tasks, this can be done directly on the command-line (which is mostly
useful when debugging or developing):

.. code-block:: sh

   ./weblate/examples/celery start
   ./weblate/examples/celery stop

.. note::

   The Celery process has to be executed under the same user as the WSGI
   process, otherwise files in the :setting:`DATA_DIR` will be stored with
   mixed ownership, leading to runtime issues.

   See also :ref:`file-permissions` and :ref:`server`.

Executing Celery tasks in the wsgi using eager mode
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

.. note::

   This will have severe performance impact on the web interface, and will
   break features depending on regular trigger (for example committing pending
   changes, digest notifications, or backups).

For development, you might want to use eager configuration, which does process
all tasks in place:

.. code-block:: python

   CELERY_TASK_ALWAYS_EAGER = True
   CELERY_BROKER_URL = "memory://"
   CELERY_TASK_EAGER_PROPAGATES = True

Running Celery as system service
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Most likely you will want to run Celery as a daemon and that is covered by
:doc:`celery:userguide/daemonizing`. For the most common Linux setup using
systemd, you can use the example files shipped in the :file:`examples` folder
listed below.

Systemd unit to be placed as :file:`/etc/systemd/system/celery-weblate.service`:

.. literalinclude:: ../../weblate/examples/celery-weblate.service
    :language: ini

Environment configuration to be placed as :file:`/etc/default/celery-weblate`:

.. literalinclude:: ../../weblate/examples/celery-weblate.conf
    :language: sh

Additional configuration to rotate Celery logs using :command:`logrotate` to be
placed as :file:`/etc/logrotate.d/celery`:

.. literalinclude:: ../../weblate/examples/celery-weblate.logrotate
    :language: text

Periodic tasks using Celery beat
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Weblate comes with built-in setup for scheduled tasks. You can however define
additional tasks in :file:`settings.py`, for example see :ref:`lazy-commit`.

The tasks are supposed to be executed by Celery beats daemon. In case it is not
working properly, it might not be running or its database was corrupted. Check
the Celery startup logs in such case to figure out root cause.

Monitoring Celery status
++++++++++++++++++++++++

You can find current length of the Celery task queues in the
:ref:`management-interface` or you can use :djadmin:`celery_queues` on the
command-line. In case the queue will get too long, you will also get
configuration error in the admin interface.

.. warning::

   The Celery errors are by default only logged into Celery log and are not
   visible to user. In case you want to have overview on such failures, it is
   recommended to configure :ref:`collecting-errors`.

.. seealso::

   :doc:`celery:userguide/configuration`,
   :doc:`celery:userguide/workers`,
   :doc:`celery:userguide/daemonizing`,
   :doc:`celery:userguide/monitoring`,
   :djadmin:`celery_queues`


Monitoring Weblate
------------------

Weblate provides the ``/healthz/`` URL to be used in simple health checks, for example
using Kubernetes. The Docker container has built-in health check using this URL.

For monitoring metrics of Weblate you can use :http:get:`/api/metrics/` API endpoint.

.. seealso::

   `Weblate plugin for Munin <https://github.com/WeblateOrg/munin>`_

.. _collecting-errors:

Collecting error reports
------------------------

Weblate, as any other software, can fail. In order to collect useful failure
states we recommend to use third party services to collect such information.
This is especially useful in case of failing Celery tasks, which would
otherwise only report error to the logs and you won't get notified on them.
Weblate has support for the following services:

Sentry
++++++

Weblate has built-in support for `Sentry <https://sentry.io/>`_. To use
it, it's enough to set :setting:`SENTRY_DSN` in the :file:`settings.py`:

.. code-block:: python

   SENTRY_DSN = "https://id@your.sentry.example.com/"

Rollbar
+++++++

Weblate has built-in support for `Rollbar <https://rollbar.com/>`_. To use
it, it's enough to follow instructions for `Rollbar notifier for Python <https://docs.rollbar.com/docs/python/>`_.

In short, you need to adjust :file:`settings.py`:

.. code-block:: python

    # Add rollbar as last middleware:
    MIDDLEWARE = [
        # … other middleware classes …
        "rollbar.contrib.django.middleware.RollbarNotifierMiddleware",
    ]

    # Configure client access
    ROLLBAR = {
        "access_token": "POST_SERVER_ITEM_ACCESS_TOKEN",
        "client_token": "POST_CLIENT_ITEM_ACCESS_TOKEN",
        "environment": "development" if DEBUG else "production",
        "branch": "main",
        "root": "/absolute/path/to/code/root",
    }

Everything else is integrated automatically, you will now collect both server
and client side errors.

.. note:

    Error logging also includes exceptions that were gracefully handled, but
    might indicate a problem - such as failed parsing of an uploaded file.

Migrating Weblate to another server
-----------------------------------

Migrating Weblate to another server should be pretty easy, however it stores
data in few locations which you should migrate carefully. The best approach is
to stop Weblate for the migration.

Migrating database
++++++++++++++++++

Depending on your database backend, you might have several options to migrate
the database. The most straightforward one is to dump the database on one
server and import it on the new one. Alternatively you can use replication in
case your database supports it.

The best approach is to use database native tools, as they are usually the most
effective (e.g. :command:`mysqldump` or :command:`pg_dump`). If you want to
migrate between different databases, the only option might be to use Django
management to dump and import the database:

.. code-block:: sh

    # Export current data
    weblate dumpdata > /tmp/weblate.dump
    # Import dump
    weblate loaddata /tmp/weblate.dump

Migrating VCS repositories
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++

The VCS repositories stored under :setting:`DATA_DIR` need to be migrated as
well. You can simply copy them or use :command:`rsync` to do the migration
more effectively.

Other notes

Don't forget to move other services Weblate might have been using like
Redis, Cron jobs or custom authentication backends.
