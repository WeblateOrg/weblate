Language definitions
====================

To present different translations properly, info about language name,
text direction, plural definitions and language code is needed.
Definitions for about 350 languages are included.

.. _language-parsing-codes:

Parsing language codes
----------------------

While parsing translations, Weblate attempts to map language code
(usually the ISO 639-1 one) to any existing language object.

If no exact match can be found, an attempt will be made
to best fit it into an existing language (e.g. ignoring the default country code
for a given languageâ€”choosing ``cs`` instead of ``cs_CZ``).

Should that also fail, a new language definition will be created using the defaults (left
to right text direction, one plural) and naming of the language as :guilabel:`xx_XX (generated)`.
You might want to change this in the admin interface later, (see :ref:`changing-languages`)
and report it to the issue tracker (see :ref:`contributing`).

.. hint::

   In case you see something unwanted as a language, you might want to adjust
   :ref:`component-language_regex` to ignore such file when parsing
   translations.

.. _changing-languages:

Changing language definitions
-----------------------------

You can change language definitions in the languages interface
(:file:`/languages/` URL).

While editing, make sure all fields are correct (especially plurals and
text direction), otherwise translators will be unable to properly edit
those translations.

Language definitions
--------------------

Each language consists of following fields:

.. _language-code:

Language code
+++++++++++++

Code identifying the language. Weblate prefers two letter codes as defined by
`ISO 639-1 <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_639-1>`_, but uses `ISO 639-2
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_639-2>`_ or `ISO 639-3
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_639-3>`_ codes for languages that do not
have two letter code. It can also support extended codes as defined by `BCP 47
<https://tools.ietf.org/html/bcp47>`_.

.. _language-name:

Language name
+++++++++++++

Visible name of the language. The language names included in Weblate are also being localized depending on user interface language.

.. _language-direction:

Text direction
++++++++++++++

Determines whether language is written right to left or left to right. This
properly is autodetected correctly for most of the languages.

.. _plural-number:

Plural number
+++++++++++++

Number of plurals used in the language.

.. _plural-formula:

Plural formula
++++++++++++++

Gettext compatible plural formula used to determine which plural form is used for given count.
