Management interface
====================

The management interface offer administration settings under the
:file:`/manage/` URL. It is available for users signed in with admin
privileges, accessible by using the wrench icon top right:

It includes basic overview of your Weblate:

* Support status, see :doc:`support`
* Backups, see :doc:`backup`
* Shared translation memory, see :doc:`memory`
* Performance report to review Weblate health and length of Celery queues
* SSH keys management, see :ref:`ssh-repos`
* Alerts overview for all components, see :ref:`alerts`

.. _admin-interface:

The Django admin interface
++++++++++++++++++++++++++

.. warning::

   Will be removed in the future,
   as its use is discouragedâ€”most features can be managed directly in Weblate.

Here you can manage objects stored in the database, such as users, translations
and other settings:

In the :guilabel:`Reports` section, you can check the status of your site, tweak
it for :ref:`production`, or manage SSH keys used to access :ref:`vcs-repos`.

Manage database objects under any of the sections.
The most interesting one is probably :guilabel:`Weblate translations`,
where you can manage translatable projects, see :ref:`project` and :ref:`component`.

:guilabel:`Weblate languages` holds language definitions, explained further in
:ref:`languages`.

Adding a project
----------------

Adding a project serves as container for all components.
Usually you create one project for one piece of software, or book
(See :ref:`project` for info on individual parameters):
