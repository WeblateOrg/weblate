The Django admin interface
++++++++++++++++++++++++++

.. warning::

   Will be removed in the future,
   as its use is discouragedâ€”most features can be managed directly in Weblate.

Here you can manage objects stored in the database, such as users, translations
and other settings:

In the :guilabel:`Reports` section, you can check the status of your site, tweak
it for :ref:`production`, or manage SSH keys used to access :ref:`vcs-repos`.

Manage database objects under any of the sections.
The most interesting one is probably :guilabel:`Weblate translations`,
where you can manage translatable projects, see :ref:`project` and :ref:`component`.

:guilabel:`Weblate languages` holds language definitions, explained further in
:ref:`languages`.

Adding a project
----------------

Adding a project serves as container for all components.
Usually you create one project for one piece of software, or book
(See :ref:`project` for info on individual parameters):
