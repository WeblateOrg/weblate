Announcements
=============

.. versionchanged:: 4.0

   In prior releases this feature was called whiteboard messages.

Provide info to your translators by posting announcements, site-wide, per project, component, or language.

Announce the purpose, deadlines, status, or specify targets for translation.

The users will receive notification on the announcements for watched
projects (unless they opt out).

This can be useful for various things from announcing the purpose of the website to
specifying targets for translations.

The announcements can posted on each level in the :guilabel:`Manage` menu, using
:guilabel:`Post announcement`:
