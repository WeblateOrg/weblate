Announcements
=============

.. versionchanged:: 4.0

   In prior releases this feature was called whiteboard messages.

You can use announcements to give some information to your translators.  The
message can be site-wide or targeted to a translation project, component or
language.  The users will receive notification on the announcements for watched
projects (unless they opt out).

This can be useful for various things from announcing the purpose of the website to
specifying targets for translations.

The messages can set on each level in the :guilabel:`Manage` menu, using
:guilabel:`Post announcement`:
