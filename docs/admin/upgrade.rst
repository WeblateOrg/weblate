Upgrading Weblate
=================

Docker-image upgrades
---------------------

The official Weblate Docker image (see :doc:`install/docker`) has all
upgrade steps integrated. There are no manual step besides pulling
the latest version.

.. _generic-upgrade-instructions:

Generic upgrade instructions
----------------------------

Always look for changes to :ref:`requirements` before upgrading, as they might
have changed. Once all requirements are installed or upgraded, ensure your
:file:`settings.py` matches :file:`settings_example.py`.

Always check :ref:`version-specific-instructions` before upgrading.
Either follow the instructions for each new version, or go with the less
tested option of upgrading across multiple releases by following all the
instructions for them at once.

.. note::

    Always back up the full database before upgrading so that you
    can revert your changes in case the upgrade fails, see :doc:`backup`.

#. Stop the WSGI and Celery processes. The upgrade can make incompatible changes
   in the database, so it is safer to avoid old processes running while upgrading.

#. Upgrade the Weblate codebase.

   For pip installs it can be achieved by:

   .. code-block:: sh

      pip install -U Weblate

   With Git checkout, you need to fetch the new source code and update your installation:

   .. code-block:: sh

        cd weblate-src
        git pull
        # Update Weblate inside your virtualenv
        . ~/weblate-env/bin/pip install -e .
        # Install dependencies directly when not using virtualenv
        pip install --upgrade -r requirements.txt

#. Follow the steps in :file:`settings_example.py` or
   :ref:`version-specific-instructions` to upgrade the configuration file.

#. Upgrade the database structure:

   .. code-block:: sh

        weblate migrate --noinput

#. Collect updated static files (see :ref:`server` and :ref:`static-files`):

   .. code-block:: sh

        weblate collectstatic --noinput

#. Compress JavaScript and CSS files (optional, see :ref:`production-compress`):

   .. code-block:: sh

        weblate compress

#. If you are running a Web√∏ate version from Git, regenerate locale files
   every time you upgrade:

   .. code-block:: sh

        weblate compilemessages

#. Verify your setup is sane (see also :ref:`production`):

   .. code-block:: sh

        weblate check --deploy

#. Restart the Celery worker (see :ref:`celery`).


.. _version-specific-instructions:

Version-specific instructions
-----------------------------

Upgrade from 2.x
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If upgrading from a 2.x release, always upgrade to 3.0.1 first and then
continue upgrading in the 3.x series. Upgrades skipping this step are not
supported and will break.

.. seealso::

   `Upgrading from 2.20 to 3.0, in the Weblate 3.0 documentation <https://docs.weblate.org/en/weblate-3.0.1/admin/upgrade.html#upgrade-3>`_

Upgrade from 3.x
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If upgrading from a 3.x release, always upgrade to 4.0.4 or 4.1.1 first
and then continue upgrading in the 4.x series. Upgrades skipping this step are
not supported and will break.

.. seealso::

   `Upgrading from 3.11 to 4.0, in the Weblate 4.0 documentation <https://docs.weblate.org/en/weblate-4.0.4/admin/upgrade.html#upgrade-from-3-11-to-4-0>`_

Upgrading from 4.0 to 4.1
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Please follow :ref:`generic-upgrade-instructions` to upgrade.

Notable configuration- or dependency changes:

* Several changes in :file:`settings_example.py`, most notable middleware changes, please adjust your settings accordingly.
* new file formats. You might want to include them in case you modified the :setting:`WEBLATE_FORMATS`.
* New quality checks. You might want to include them in case you modified the :setting:`CHECK_LIST`.
* A change in the ``DEFAULT_THROTTLE_CLASSES`` setting allows reporting rate limiting in the API.
* Some new and updated requirements.
* A change in :setting:`django:INSTALLED_APPS`.
* The ``MT_DEEPL_API_VERSION`` setting has been removed in version 4.7. The :ref:`deepl` machine translation now uses the new :setting:`MT_DEEPL_API_URL` instead. You might need to adjust :setting:`MT_DEEPL_API_URL` to match your subsciption.

.. seealso:: :ref:`generic-upgrade-instructions`

Upgrading from 4.1 to 4.2
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Please follow :ref:`generic-upgrade-instructions` to upgrade.

Notable configuration or dependency changes:

* Upgrading from any 3.x releases is no longer supported. Please upgrade to 4.0 or 4.1 first.
* Some new and updated requirements.
* Several changes in :file:`settings_example.py`, most notably new middleware and changed application ordering.
* The keys for JSON based formats no longer include a leading dot. Strings are adjusted during the database migration, but external components might need adjusting if you rely on keys in exports or the API.
* The Celery configuration no longer uses the ``memory`` queue. Please adjust your startup scripts and ``CELERY_TASK_ROUTES`` setting.
* The Weblate domain is now configured in the settings. See :setting:`SITE_DOMAIN` (or :envvar:`WEBLATE_SITE_DOMAIN`). You will have to configure it before running Weblate.
* The username and e-mail fields in the user database are now case-insensitive unique. It was mistakenly not enforced with PostgreSQL.

.. seealso:: :ref:`generic-upgrade-instructions`

Upgrading from 4.2 to 4.3
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Please follow :ref:`generic-upgrade-instructions` to upgrade.

Notable configuration or dependencies changes:

* Some quality check changes. You might want to include them if you modified the :setting:`CHECK_LIST`.
* The source language attribute was moved from project to a component exposed in the API. You will need to update :ref:`wlc` if you are using it.
* The database migration to 4.3 might take a while, depending on the number of strings you are translating. (Expect around one hour of migration time per 100,000 source strings.)
* One change in :setting:`django:INSTALLED_APPS`.
* A new setting :setting:`SESSION_COOKIE_AGE_AUTHENTICATED` complements :setting:`django:SESSION_COOKIE_AGE`.
* If you were using :command:`hub` or :command:`lab` to integrate with GitHub or GitLab, you will need to reconfigure this. See :setting:`GITHUB_CREDENTIALS` and :setting:`GITLAB_CREDENTIALS`.

.. versionchanged:: 4.3.1

   * The Celery configuration changed to add a ``memory`` queue. Please adjust your startup scripts and ``CELERY_TASK_ROUTES`` setting.

.. seealso:: :ref:`generic-upgrade-instructions`

Upgrading from 4.3 to 4.4
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Please follow :ref:`generic-upgrade-instructions` in order to upgrade.

Notable configuration or dependency changes:

* One change in :setting:`django:INSTALLED_APPS`. ``weblate.configuration`` has to be added there.
* Django 3.1 is now required.
* If you are using MySQL or MariaDB, the minimal required versions increased, see :ref:`mysql`.

.. versionchanged:: 4.4.1

   * :ref:`mono_gettext` now uses both ``msgid`` and ``msgctxt`` when present. This changes identification of translation strings in such files, breaking links to extended Weblate data such as screenshots or review states. Please ensure you commit pending changes in such files prior to upgrading. It is recommended to force-load affected components using :djadmin:`loadpo`.
   * The minimal required version of translate-toolkit incresed to address several file-format issues.

.. seealso:: :ref:`generic-upgrade-instructions`

Upgrading from 4.4 to 4.5
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Please follow :ref:`generic-upgrade-instructions` to upgrade.

.. _py3:

Upgrading from Python 2 to Python 3
-----------------------------------

Weblate no longer supports Python older than 3.5. If you are still running
on older version, please migrate to Python 3 first on an existing Weblate
version, and upgrade later. Read `Upgrading from Python 2 to Python 3 in the Weblate
3.11.1 documentation
<https://docs.weblate.org/en/weblate-3.11.1/admin/upgrade.html#upgrading-from-python-2-to-python-3>`_.

.. _database-migration:

Migrating from other databases to PostgreSQL
--------------------------------------------

If you are running Weblate on a dabatase other than PostgreSQL, consider
migrating to it to get the best Weblate performance. The following
steps guides you through migrating your data between the databases: (Please
remember to stop both the web and Celery servers prior to the migration,
otherwise you might end up with inconsistent data.)

Creating a database in PostgreSQL
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

It is usually a good idea to run Weblate in a separate database, and separate user account:

.. code-block:: sh

    # If PostgreSQL was not installed before, set the main password
    sudo -u postgres psql postgres -c "\password postgres"

    # Create a database user called "weblate"
    sudo -u postgres createuser -D -P weblate

    # Create the database "weblate" owned by "weblate"
    sudo -u postgres createdb -E UTF8 -O weblate weblate

Migrating using Django JSON dumps
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The simplest approach for migration of smaller installations is to use Django JSON dumps.
On bigger sites you might want to use pgloader instead. Read :ref:`pgloader-migration`.

1. Add PostgreSQL as an additional database connection to the :file:`settings.py`:

.. code-block:: python

    DATABASES = {
        "default": {
            # Database engine
            "ENGINE": "django.db.backends.mysql",
            # Database name
            "NAME": "weblate",
            # Database user
            "USER": "weblate",
            # Database password
            "PASSWORD": "yourpassword",
            # Set to empty string for localhost
            "HOST": "database.example.com",
            # Set to empty string for default
            "PORT": "",
            # Additional database options
            "OPTIONS": {
                # In case of using an older MySQL server, which has MyISAM as a default storage
                # 'init_command': 'SET storage_engine=INNODB',
                # Uncomment for MySQL older than 5.7:
                # 'init_command': "SET sql_mode='STRICT_TRANS_TABLES'",
                # If your server supports it, see the Unicode issues above
                "charset": "utf8mb4",
                # Change connection timeout in case you get MySQL gone away error:
                "connect_timeout": 28800,
            },
        },
        "postgresql": {
            # Database engine
            "ENGINE": "django.db.backends.postgresql",
            # Database name
            "NAME": "weblate",
            # Database user
            "USER": "weblate",
            # Database password
            "PASSWORD": "yourpassword",
            # Set to empty string for localhost
            "HOST": "database.example.com",
            # Set to empty string for default
            "PORT": "",
        },
    }

2. Run migrations and drop any data inserted into the tables:

.. code-block:: sh

   weblate migrate --database=postgresql
   weblate sqlflush --database=postgresql | weblate dbshell --database=postgresql

3. Dump the legacy database and import it in PostgreSQL

.. code-block:: sh

   weblate dumpdata --all --output weblate.json
   weblate loaddata weblate.json --database=postgresql

4. Adjust :setting:`django:DATABASES` to only use the PostgreSQL database,
   remove legacy connection.

Weblate should now be ready to run from the PostgreSQL database.

.. _pgloader-migration:

Migrating to PostgreSQL using pgloader
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The `pgloader`_ is a generic migration tool to migrate data to PostgreSQL. You can use it to migrate Weblate database.

1. Adjust your :file:`settings.py` to use PostgreSQL as your database.

2. Migrate the schema in the PostgreSQL database:

   .. code-block:: sh

       weblate migrate
       weblate sqlflush | weblate dbshell

3. Run the pgloader to transfer the data.
The following script can be used to migrate the database, but you might want to learn more about `pgloader`_
to understand what it does and to tweak it to match your setup:

   .. code-block:: postgresql

       LOAD DATABASE
            FROM      mysql://weblate:password@localhost/weblate
            INTO postgresql://weblate:password@localhost/weblate

       WITH include no drop, truncate, create no tables, create no indexes, no foreign keys, disable triggers, reset sequences, data only

       ALTER SCHEMA 'weblate' RENAME TO 'public'
       ;

.. _pootle-migration:

Migrating from Pootle
---------------------

As Weblate was originally written as a replacement from Pootle,
user accounts can be migrated from it. You can dump all user account data
from Pootle and import it using :djadmin:`importusers`.
