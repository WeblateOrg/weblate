Upgrading Weblate
=================

.. _generic-upgrade-instructions:

Generic upgrade instructions
----------------------------

Before upgrading, please check the current :ref:`requirements` as they might have
changed. Once all requirements are installed or updated, please adjust your
:file:`settings.py` to match changes in the configuration (consult
:file:`settings_example.py` for correct values).

Always check :ref:`version-specific-instructions` before upgrade. In case you
are skipping some versions, please follow instructions for all versions you are
skipping in the upgrade. Sometimes it's better to upgrade to some intermediate
version to ensure a smooth migration. Upgrading across multiple releases should
work, but is not as well tested as single version upgrades.

.. note::

    It is recommended to perform a full database backup prior to upgrade so that you
    can roll back the database in case upgrade fails, see :doc:`backup`.

1. Upgrade configuration file, refer to :file:`settings_example.py` or
   :ref:`version-specific-instructions` for needed steps.

2. Upgrade database structure:

   .. code-block:: sh

        ./manage.py migrate --noinput

3. Collect updated static files (mostly javascript and CSS):

   .. code-block:: sh

        ./manage.py collectstatic --noinput

4. Update language definitions (this is not necessary, but heavily recommended):

   .. code-block:: sh

        ./manage.py setuplang

5. Optionally upgrade default set of privileges definitions (you might want to
   add new permissions manually if you have heavily tweaked access control):

   .. code-block:: sh

        ./manage.py setupgroups

6. If you are running version from Git, you should also regenerate locale files
   every time you are upgrading. You can do this by invoking:

   .. code-block:: sh

        ./manage.py compilemessages

7. Verify that your setup is sane (see also :ref:`production`):

   .. code-block:: sh

        ./manage.py check --deploy

8. Restart celery worker (see :ref:`celery`).

.. _py3:

Upgrading from Python 2 to Python 3
-----------------------------------

Weblate currently supports both Python 2.7 and 3.x. Upgrading existing
installations is supported, but you should pay attention to some data stored on
the disk as it might be incompatible between these two.

Things which might be problematic include Whoosh indices and file based caches.
Fortunately these are easy to handle. Recommended upgrade steps:

1. Backup your :ref:`translation-memory` using :djadmin:`dump_memory`:

   .. code-block:: sh

         ./manage.py dump_memory > memory.json

2. Upgrade your installation to Python 3.
3. Delete :ref:`translation-memory` database :djadmin:`delete_memory`:

   .. code-block:: sh

         ./manage.py delete_memory --all

4. Restore your :ref:`translation-memory` using :djadmin:`import_memory`.

   .. code-block:: sh

         ./manage.py import_memory memory.json

5. Recreate fulltext index using :djadmin:`rebuild_index`:

   .. code-block:: sh

      ./manage.py rebuild_index --clean --all

6. Cleanup avatar cache (if using file based) using :djadmin:`cleanup_avatar_cache`.

   .. code-block:: sh

      ./manage.py cleanup_avatar_cache

7. It is recommended to throw away your caches.

.. _pootle-migration:

Migrating from Pootle
---------------------

As Weblate was originally written as replacement from Pootle, it is supported
to migrate user accounts from Pootle. You can dump the users from Pootle and
import them using :djadmin:`importusers`.
