Upgrading Weblate
=================

Docker image upgrades
---------------------

The official Docker image (see :doc:`install/docker`) has all reqiored upgrade
steps integrated. No manual interaction is needed besides pulling the latest version.

.. _generic-upgrade-instructions:

Generic upgrade instructions
----------------------------

Before upgrading, please check the current :ref:`requirements`, as they might have
changed. Once all requirements are installed or upgraded, please adjust your
:file:`settings.py` to match changes in the configuration (consult
:file:`settings_example.py` for correct values).

Always check :ref:`version-specific-instructions` before upgrading. In case you
are skipping some versions, please follow instructions for all versions you are
skipping in the upgrade. Sometimes it is better to upgrade to some intermediate
version to ensure a smooth migration. Upgrading across multiple releases should
work, but is not as extensively tested as single version upgrades.

.. note::

    It is recommended to perform a full database backup prior to upgrading so that you
    can roll back the database in case the upgrade fails, see :doc:`backup`.

#. Stop the WSGI and Celery processes. The upgrade can perform incompatible changes in
   the database, so it is always safer to avoid having old processes running while
   upgrading.

#. Upgrade the Weblate source code.

   For pip installs it can be achieved by:

   .. code-block:: sh

      pip install -U "Weblate[all]"

   If you don't want to install all of the optional dependencies do:

   .. code-block:: sh

      pip install -U Weblate

   With Git checkout you need to fetch the new source code and update your installation:

   .. code-block:: sh

        cd weblate-src
        git pull
        # Update Weblate inside your virtualenv
        . ~/weblate-env/bin/pip install -e .
        # Install dependencies directly when not using virtualenv
        pip install --upgrade -r requirements.txt
        # Install optional dependencies directly when not using virtualenv
        pip install --upgrade -r requirements-optional.txt

#. New Weblate release might have new :ref:`optional-deps`, please check if they cover
   features you want.

#. Upgrade the configuration file, by referring to :file:`settings_example.py` or
   :ref:`version-specific-instructions` for needed steps.

#. Upgrade the Weblate database structure:

   .. code-block:: sh

        weblate migrate --noinput

#. Collect updated static files (see :ref:`server` and :ref:`static-files`):

   .. code-block:: sh

        weblate collectstatic --noinput

#. Compress JavaScript and CSS files (optional, see :ref:`production-compress`):

   .. code-block:: sh

        weblate compress

#. If you are running a Weblate version from Git, you should also regenerate locale
   files every time you upgrade. You can do this by invoking:

   .. code-block:: sh

        weblate compilemessages

#. Verify that your setup is sane (see also :ref:`production`):

   .. code-block:: sh

        weblate check --deploy

#. Restart the Celery worker (see :ref:`celery`).

.. _py3:

Upgrading from Python 2 to Python 3
-----------------------------------

Weblate no longer supports Python older than 3.5. In case you are still running
on older version, please perform a migration to Python 3 first on the existing
version and upgrade it later. See `Upgrading from Python 2 to Python 3 in the Weblate
3.11.1 documentation
<https://docs.weblate.org/en/weblate-3.11.1/admin/upgrade.html#upgrading-from-python-2-to-python-3>`_.

.. _database-migration:

Migrating from other databases to PostgreSQL
--------------------------------------------

If you are not running Weblate with a different databse,
you should migrate your data to PostgreSQL for better performance by doing the following steps.
Stop both the web- and Celery servers beforehand, otherwise you might end up with inconsistent data.

Creating a database in PostgreSQL
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

It is usually a good idea to run Weblate in a separate database, and separate user account:

.. code-block:: sh

    # If PostgreSQL was not installed before, set the main password
    sudo -u postgres psql postgres -c "\password postgres"

    # Create a database user called "weblate"
    sudo -u postgres createuser -D -P weblate

    # Create the database "weblate" owned by "weblate"
    sudo -u postgres createdb -E UTF8 -O weblate weblate

Migrating using Django JSON dumps
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The simplest migration approach is to utilize Django JSON dumps. This works well for smaller installations. On bigger sites you might want to use pgloader instead, see :ref:`pgloader-migration`.

1. Add PostgreSQL as additional database connection to the :file:`settings.py`:

.. code-block:: python

    DATABASES = {
        "default": {
            # Database engine
            "ENGINE": "django.db.backends.mysql",
            # Database name
            "NAME": "weblate",
            # Database user
            "USER": "weblate",
            # Database password
            "PASSWORD": "password",
            # Set to empty string for localhost
            "HOST": "database.example.com",
            # Set to empty string for default
            "PORT": "",
            # Additional database options
            "OPTIONS": {
                # In case of using an older MySQL server, which has MyISAM as a default storage
                # 'init_command': 'SET storage_engine=INNODB',
                # Uncomment for MySQL older than 5.7:
                # 'init_command': "SET sql_mode='STRICT_TRANS_TABLES'",
                # If your server supports it, see the Unicode issues above
                "charset": "utf8mb4",
                # Change connection timeout in case you get MySQL gone away error:
                "connect_timeout": 28800,
            },
        },
        "postgresql": {
            # Database engine
            "ENGINE": "django.db.backends.postgresql",
            # Database name
            "NAME": "weblate",
            # Database user
            "USER": "weblate",
            # Database password
            "PASSWORD": "password",
            # Set to empty string for localhost
            "HOST": "database.example.com",
            # Set to empty string for default
            "PORT": "",
        },
    }

2. Run migrations and drop any data inserted into the tables:

.. code-block:: sh

   weblate migrate --database=postgresql
   weblate sqlflush --database=postgresql | weblate dbshell --database=postgresql

3. Dump legacy database and import to PostgreSQL

.. code-block:: sh

   weblate dumpdata --all --output weblate.json
   weblate loaddata weblate.json --database=postgresql

4. Adjust :setting:`django:DATABASES` to use a PostgreSQL database exclusively by default,
   remove legacy connection.

Weblate should be now ready to run from the PostgreSQL database.

.. _pgloader-migration:

Migrating to PostgreSQL using pgloader
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The `pgloader`_ is a generic migration tool to migrate data to PostgreSQL. You can use it to migrate Weblate database.

1. Adjust your :file:`settings.py` to use PostgreSQL as a database.

2. Migrate the schema in the PostgreSQL database:

   .. code-block:: sh

       weblate migrate
       weblate sqlflush | weblate dbshell

3. Run the pgloader to transfer the data. The following script can be used to migrate the database, but you might want to learn more about `pgloader`_ to understand what it does and tweak it to match your setup:

   .. code-block:: postgresql

       LOAD DATABASE
            FROM      mysql://weblate:password@localhost/weblate
            INTO postgresql://weblate:password@localhost/weblate

       WITH include no drop, truncate, create no tables, create no indexes, no foreign keys, disable triggers, reset sequences, data only

       ALTER SCHEMA 'weblate' RENAME TO 'public'
       ;


.. _pgloader: https://pgloader.io/

.. _pootle-migration:

Migrating from Pootle
---------------------

Migrate user accounts by dumping the list of users from Pootle and
import them using :djadmin:`importusers`.
