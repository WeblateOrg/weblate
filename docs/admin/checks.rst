Checks and fixups
=================

.. _custom-autofix:

Custom automatic fixups
-----------------------

You can also implement your own automatic fixup in addition to the standard ones and
include them in :setting:`AUTOFIX_LIST`.

The automatic fixes are powerful, but can also cause damage;  be careful when
writing one.

For example, the following automatic fixup would replace every occurrence of the string
``foo`` in a translation with ``bar``:

.. literalinclude:: ../../weblate/examples/fix_foo.py
    :language: python

To install custom checks, provide a fully-qualified path to the Python class
in the :setting:`AUTOFIX_LIST`, see :ref:`custom-check-modules`.

.. _custom-checks:

Customizing behavior
--------------------

You can fine-tune the behavior of Weblate (mostly checks) for each source
string (in source strings review, see :ref:`additional`) or in the
:ref:`component` (:ref:`component-check_flags`). Some file formats also allow
to specify flags directly in the format (see :ref:`formats`).

The flags are comma-separated, the parameters are separated with colon. You can
use quotes to include whitespace or special chars in the string. For example:

.. code-block:: text

   placeholders:"special:value":"other value", regex:.*

Here is a list of flags currently accepted:

``rst-text``
    Treat a text as an reStructuredText document, affects :ref:`check-same`.
``md-text``
    Treat text as a Markdown document.
``dos-eol``
    Uses DOS end-of-line markers instead of Unix ones (``\r\n`` instead of ``\n``).
``url``
    The string should consist of only a URL.
``safe-html``
    The string should be HTML safe, see :ref:`check-safe-html`.
``read-only``
    The string is read-only and should not be edited in Weblate, see :ref:`read-only-strings`.
``priority:N``
    Priority of the string. Higher priority strings are presented first for translation.
    The default priority is 100, the higher priority a string has, the earlier it is
    offered for translation.
``max-length:N``
    Limit the maximal length for a string to N characters, see :ref:`check-max-length`.
``xml-text``
    Treat text as XML document, affects :ref:`check-xml-invalid` and :ref:`check-xml-tags`.
``font-family:NAME``
    Define font-family for rendering checks, see :ref:`fonts`.
``font-weight:WEIGHT``
    Define font-weight for rendering checks, see :ref:`fonts`.
``font-size:SIZE``
    Define font-size for rendering checks, see :ref:`fonts`.
``font-spacing:SPACING``
    Define font-spacing for rendering checks, see :ref:`fonts`.
``placeholders:NAME``
    Placeholder strings expected in translation, see :ref:`check-placeholders`.
``replacements:FROM:TO:FROM2:TO2...``
    Replacements to perform when checking resulting text parameters (for
    example in :ref:`check-max-size` or :ref:`check-max-length`). The typical
    use case for this is to expand placeables to ensure that the text fits even
    with long names, for example: ``replacements:%s:"John Doe"``.
``regex:REGEX``
    Regular expression to match translation, see :ref:`check-regex`.
``python-format``, ``c-format``, ``php-format``, ``python-brace-format``, ``javascript-format``, ``c-sharp-format``, ``java-format``, ``java-messageformat``, ``auto-java-messageformat``, ``qt-format``, ``qt-plural-format``, ``ruby-format``, ``vue-format``

.. note::

    Generally the rule is named ``ignore-*`` for any check, using its
    identifier, so you can use this even for your custom checks.

These flags are understood both in :ref:`component` settings, per source string
settings and in the translation file itself (for example in GNU gettext).

.. _enforcing-checks:

Enforcing checks
----------------

.. versionadded:: 3.11

You can configure a list of checks which can not be ignored by setting
:ref:`component-enforced_checks` in :ref:`component`. Each listed check can not
be ignored in the user interface and any string failing this check is marked as
:guilabel:`Needs editing` (see :ref:`states`).

.. _fonts:

Managing fonts
--------------

.. versionadded:: 3.7

The :ref:`check-max-size` check used to calculate dimensions of the rendered
text needs font to be loaded into Weblate and selected using a translation flag
(see :ref:`custom-checks`).

Weblate font management tool in :guilabel:`Fonts` under the :guilabel:`Manage`
menu of your translation project provides interface to upload and manage fonts.
TrueType or OpenType fonts can be uploaded, set up font-groups and use those in
the check.

The font-groups allow you to define different fonts for different languages,
which is typically needed for non-latin languages:

.. image:: /images/font-group-edit.png

The font-groups are identified by name, which can not contain whitespace or
special characters, so that it can be easily used in the check definition:

.. image:: /images/font-group-list.png

Font-family and style is automatically recognized after uploading them:

.. image:: /images/font-edit.png

You can have a number of fonts loaded into Weblate:

.. image:: /images/font-list.png

To use the fonts for checking the string length, pass it the appropriate
flags (see :ref:`custom-checks`). You will probably need the following ones:

``max-size:500``
   Defines maximal width.
``font-family:ubuntu``
   Defines font group to use by specifying its identifier.
``font-size:22``
   Defines font size.


.. _own-checks:

Writing own checks
------------------

A wide range of quality checks are built-in, (see :ref:`checks`), though
they might not cover everything you want to check. The list of performed checks
can be adjusted using :setting:`CHECK_LIST`, and you can also add custom checks.

1. Subclass the `weblate.checks.Check`
2. Set a few attributes.
3. Implement either the ``check`` (if you want to deal with plurals in your code) or
   the ``check_single`` method (which does it for you).

Some examples:

To install custom checks, provide a fully-qualified path to the Python class
in the :setting:`CHECK_LIST`, see :ref:`custom-check-modules`.

Checking translation text does not contain "foo"
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This is a pretty simple check which just checks whether the translation is missing
the string "foo".

.. literalinclude:: ../../weblate/examples/check_foo.py
    :language: python

Checking that Czech translation text plurals differ
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Check using language info to verify the two plural forms in Czech
language are not same.

.. literalinclude:: ../../weblate/examples/check_czech.py
    :language: python
