Optional Weblate modules
========================

Weblate comes with several optional modules which might be useful for your
setup.

.. _git-exporter:

Git exporter
------------

.. versionadded:: 2.10

The Git exporter provides you read only access to the underlaying Git repository
using http.

Installation
++++++++++++

To install, simply add ``weblate.gitexport`` to installed applications in
:file:`settings.py`:

.. code-block:: python

    INSTALLED_APPS += (
        'weblate.gitexport',
    )

After installing, you need to migrate your database so that existing
repositories are properly exported:

.. code-block:: sh

    ./manage.py migrate

Usage
+++++

The module automatically hooks into Weblate and sets exported repository URL in
the :ref:`component`.
The repositories are accessible under ``/git/`` path of the Weblate, for example
``https://example.org/git/weblate/master/``:

.. code-block:: sh

    git clone 'https://example.org/git/weblate/master/'

Repositories are available anonymously unless :ref:`acl` is enabled. In that
case you need to authenticate using your API token (you can obtain it in your
:ref:`user-profile`):

.. code-block:: sh

    git clone 'https://user:KEY@example.org/git/weblate/master/'


.. _billing:

Billing
-------

.. versionadded:: 2.4

Billing module is used on `Hosted Weblate <https://weblate.org/hosting/>`_
and is used to define billing plans, track invoices and usage limits.

Installation
++++++++++++

To install, simply add ``weblate.billing`` to installed applications in
:file:`settings.py`:

.. code-block:: python

    INSTALLED_APPS += (
        'weblate.billing',
    )

This module includes additional database structures, to have them installed you
should run the database migration:

.. code-block:: sh

    ./manage.py migrate

Usage
+++++

After installation you can control billing in the admin interface. Users with
billing enabled will get new :guilabel:`Billing` tab in their
:ref:`user-profile`.

.. _legal:

Legal
-----

.. versionadded:: 2.15

Legal module is used on `Hosted Weblate <https://weblate.org/hosting/>`_
and is used to provide required legal documents.

.. note::

    The module ships legal documents for the Hosted Weblate service. You are
    required to adjust the templates to match your use case.

Installation
++++++++++++

To install, simply add ``weblate.legal`` to installed applications in
:file:`settings.py`:

.. code-block:: python

    INSTALLED_APPS += (
        'weblate.legal',
    )

    # Optionals:

    # Social auth pipeline to confirm TOS on registration/login
    SOCIAL_AUTH_PIPELINE += (
        'weblate.legal.pipeline.tos_confirm',
    )

    # Middleware to enforce TOS confirmation of logged in users
    MIDDLEWARE += [
        'weblate.legal.middleware.RequireTOSMiddleware',
    ]

This module includes additional database structures, to have them installed you
should run the database migration:

.. code-block:: sh

    ./manage.py migrate

Now you should edit the legal documents to match your service. You can
find them in the :file:`weblate/legal/templates/legal/` folder.

Usage
+++++

After installation the legal documents are shown in Weblate UI.

.. _avatars:

Avatars
-------

Weblate comes with built in support for showing user avatars based on emails.
This can be disabled using :setting:`ENABLE_AVATARS`. The avatars are
downloaded and cached server side to reduce information leaks to the sites
serving them.

Weblate currently supports single backend:

* `Gravatar <https://gravatar.com/>`_

.. seealso:: 
   
   :ref:`production-cache-avatar`,
   :setting:`ENABLE_AVATARS`

Spam protection
---------------

Optionally Weblate can be protected against suggestion spamming by
unauthenticated users through `akismet.com <https://akismet.com/>`_
service.

To enable this, you need to install `akismet` Python module and configure
Akismet API key.

.. seealso::

    :setting:`AKISMET_API_KEY`


.. _gpg-sign:

Signing Git commits by GnuPG
----------------------------

.. versionadded:: 3.1

Weblate allows you to sign all commits by it's GnuPG key. To configure this,
you need to enable :setting:`WEBLATE_GPG_IDENTITY`. Weblate will generate GnuPG
key when needed and will use it to sign all translation commits.

This feature needs GnuPG 2.1 or newer installed.

You can find the key in the :setting:`DATA_DIR` and the public key is shown on
the about page:

.. image:: ../images/about-gpg.png

Alternatively you can also import existing keys into Weblate, just set
``HOME=$DATA_DIR/home`` when invoking gpg.

.. seealso::

    :setting:`WEBLATE_GPG_IDENTITY`

.. _rate-limit:

Rate limiting
-------------

.. versionchanged:: 3.2

      The rate limiting now accepts more fine grained configuration.

Several operations in Weblate are rate limited. At most
:setting:`RATELIMIT_ATTEMPTS` attempts are allowed within
:setting:`RATELIMIT_WINDOW` seconds. The user is then blocked
for :setting:`RATELIMIT_LOCKOUT`. There are also per scope variants of those
settings, eg. `RATELIMIT_CONTACT_ATTEMPTS`, see scopes below.

Following operations are subject to rate limiting:

* Registration (`REGISTRATION` scope)
* Sending message to admins (`MESSAGE` scope)
* Password authentication on login (`LOGIN` scope)
* Sitewide search (`SEARCH` scope)

Additionally if there are more than :setting:`AUTH_LOCK_ATTEMPTS` failed
authentication attempts on one account, this account password authentication is
disabled and it's not possible to login until user asks for password reset.

.. _rate-ip:

IP address for rate limiting
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

The rate limiting is based on client IP address. This is obtained from HTTP
headers and you will have to change configuration in the event Weblate is running
behind reverse proxy to work it properly.

.. seealso::

    :setting:`IP_BEHIND_REVERSE_PROXY`,
    :setting:`IP_PROXY_HEADER`,
    :setting:`IP_PROXY_OFFSET`
