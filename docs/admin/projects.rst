Translation projects
====================

Translation organization
------------------------

Weblate organizes translatable content into tree like structure. The toplevel
object is :ref:`project`, which should hold all translations which belong
together (for example translation of an application in several versions
and/or documentation). On the next level, there is :ref:`component`, which is
actually the component to translate. Here you define the VCS repository to use and
mask of files to translate. Below :ref:`component` there are individual
translations, which are handled automatically by Weblate as the translation
files (matching mask defined in :ref:`component`) appear in VCS repository.

.. note::

    You can share cloned VCS repositories using :ref:`internal-urls`. Using shared repositories feature is highly recommended when you have many components that use the same VCS. It will improve performance and use less disk space.

.. _admin-interface:

Administration
--------------

Administration of Weblate is done through standard Django admin interface,
which is available under :file:`/admin/` URL. Once logged in as user with
proper privileges, you can access it using the wrench icon in top navigation:

.. image:: ../images/admin-wrench.png

Here you can manage objects stored in the database, such as users, translations
and other settings:

.. image:: ../images/admin.png

In the :guilabel:`Reports` section you can check the status of your site, tweak
it for :ref:`production` or manage SSH keys to access :ref:`vcs-repos`.

With all sections below you can manage database objects. The most interesting one is
probably :guilabel:`Weblate translations`, where you can manage translatable
projects, see :ref:`project` and :ref:`component`.

Another section, :guilabel:`Weblate languages` holds language definitions, see
:ref:`languages` for more details.

Adding new components
---------------------

All translation components need to be available as VCS repositories and are
organized as project/component structure.

Weblate supports wide range of translation formats (both bilingual and
monolingua) supported by translate toolkit, see :ref:`formats` for more
information.

Adding project
++++++++++++++

First you have to add project, which will serve as container for all
components. Usually you create one project for one piece of software or book
(see :ref:`project` for information on individual parameters):

.. image:: ../images/add-project.png

.. seealso:: 
   
   :ref:`project`

.. _bilingual:

Bilingual components
++++++++++++++++++++

Once you have added a project, you can add translation components to it
(see :ref:`component` for information on individual parameters):

.. image:: ../images/add-component.png

.. seealso:: 
   
   :ref:`component`,
   :ref:`bimono`

.. _monolingual:

Monolingual components
++++++++++++++++++++++

For easier translating of monolingual formats, you should provide a template
file, which contains mapping of message IDs to source language (usually
English) (see :ref:`component` for information on individual parameters):

.. image:: ../images/add-component-mono.png

.. seealso:: 
   
   :ref:`component`,
   :ref:`bimono`

.. _project:

Project configuration
---------------------

To add a new component to translate, you need to create a translation project first.
The project is a sort of shelf, in which real translations are folded. All
components in the same project share suggestions and the dictionary; also the
translations are automatically propagated through all components in a single
project (unless disabled in component configuration).

The project has only a few attributes giving translators information about
the project:

Project website
    URL where translators can find more information about the project.
Mailing list
    Mailing list where translators can discuss or comment on translations.
Translation instructions
    URL where you have more detailed instructions for translators.
Set Translation-Team header
    Whether Weblate should manage Translation-Team header (this is
    :ref:`gettext` only feature right now).
Access control
    Configure per project access control, see :ref:`acl` for more details.
Enable reviews
    Enable review workflow, see :ref:`reviews`.
Enable hooks
    Whether unauthenticated :ref:`hooks` will be enabled for this repository.
Source language
    Language used for source strings in all components. Change this if you are 
    translating from something else than English.

.. note::

    Most of the fields can be edited by project owners or managers in the 
    Weblate interface.

Adjusting interaction
+++++++++++++++++++++

There are also additional features which you can control, like automatic
pushing of changes (see also :ref:`push-changes`) or
maintaining of Translation-Team header.

.. _component:

.. _subproject:

Component configuration
-----------------------

Component is real component for translating. You enter VCS repository location
and file mask for which files to translate and Weblate automatically fetches from the VCS
and finds all matching translatable files.

You can find some examples of typical configurations in the :ref:`formats`.

.. note::

    It is recommended to have translation components of reasonable size - split
    the translation by anything what makes sense in your case (individual
    applications or addons, book chapters or websites).

    Weblate easily handles translations with 10000 of units, but it is harder
    to split work and coordinate among translators with such a large translation.
    Also when one translator is working on a component, this translation is locked
    for others, see :ref:`locking`.

Should the language definition for translation be missing, an empty definition is
created and named as "cs_CZ (generated)". You should adjust the definition and
report this back to Weblate authors so that the missing language can be included in
next release.

The component contains all important parameters for working with VCS and
getting translations out of it:

Version control system
    VCS to use, see :ref:`vcs` for details.
Source code repository
    VCS repository used to pull changes, see :ref:`vcs-repos` for more details.
    
    This can be either a real VCS URL or ``weblate://project/component``
    indicating that the repository should be shared with another component.
    See :ref:`internal-urls` for more details.
Repository push URL
    Repository URL used for pushing, this is completely optional and push
    support will be disabled when this is empty. See :ref:`vcs-repos` for more
    details on how to specify repository URL.
Repository browser
    URL of repository browser to display source files (location where messages
    are used). When empty no such links will be generated.

    You can use following format strings:
        
    * ``%(branchs)s`` - current branch
    * ``%(line)s`` - line in file
    * ``%(file)s`` - filename
    * ``%(../file)s`` - filename in parent directory
    * ``%(../../file)s`` - filename in grandparent directory

    For example on GitHub, you would use something like
    ``https://github.com/WeblateOrg/hello/blob/%(branch)s/%(file)s#L%(line)s``.
Exported repository URL
    URL where changes made by Weblate are exported. This is important when
    :ref:`continuous-translation` is not used or when there is need to manually
    merge changes. You can use :ref:`git-exporter` to automate this for Git
    repositories.
Repository branch
    Which branch to checkout from the VCS and where to look for translations.
File mask
    Mask of files to translate including path. It should include one *
    replacing language code (see :ref:`languages` for information how this is 
    processed). In case your repository contains more than one translation
    files (eg. more Gettext domains), you need to create separate component for
    each.

    For example ``po/*.po`` or ``locale/*/LC_MESSAGES/django.po``.

    In case your filename contains special chars such as ``[``, ``]``, these need
    to be escaped as ``[[]`` or ``[]]``.
Monolingual base language file
    Base file containing strings definition for :ref:`monolingual`.
Edit base file
    Whether to allow editing of base file for :ref:`monolingual`.
Base file for new translations
    Base file used to generate new translations, eg. ``.pot`` file with Gettext.
File format
    Translation file format, see also :ref:`formats`.
Source string bug report address
    Email address used for reporting upstream bugs. This address will also receive
    notification about any source string comments made in Weblate.
Locked
    You can lock the translation to prevent updates by users.
Allow translation propagation
    You can disable propagation of translations to this component from other
    components within same project. This really depends on what you are
    translating, sometimes it's desirable to have same string used.

    It's usually a good idea to disable this for monolingual translations unless
    you are using the same IDs across the whole project.
Post-update script
    One of the scripts defined in :setting:`POST_UPDATE_SCRIPTS` which is executed
    after receiving update. This can be used to update the translation files.
Pre-commit script
    One of the scripts defined in :setting:`PRE_COMMIT_SCRIPTS` which is executed
    before commit. This can be used to generate some metadata about translation
    or to generate binary form of a translation.
Post-commit script
    One of the scripts defined in :setting:`POST_COMMIT_SCRIPTS` which is executed
    after commit. This can be used to notify external parties about the change.
Post-push script
    One of the scripts defined in :setting:`POST_PUSH_SCRIPTS` which is executed
    after push to remote repository. This can be used to generate notify external
    parties about the change in repository (i.e. create pull request).
Post-add script
    One of the scripts defined in :setting:`POST_ADD_SCRIPTS` which is executed
    when new translation has been added. This can be used to adjust additional
    files in the repository when adding new translation.
Additional commit files
    Additional files to include in the commit (separated by newline), usually
    this one is generated by the pre commit or post add scripts described
    above.

    Supply the ``%(language)s`` in the path like this:
    ``path/to/addditinal/%(language)s_file.example``
Save translation history
    Whether to store a history of translation changes in database.
Enable suggestions
    Whether translation suggestions are accepted for this component.
Suggestion voting
    Enable voting for suggestions, see :ref:`voting`.
Autoaccept suggestions
    Automatically accept voted suggestions, see :ref:`voting`.
Quality checks flags
    Additional flags to pass to quality checks, see :ref:`custom-checks`.
Translation license
    License of this translation.
License URL
    URL where users can find full text of a license.
New language
    How to handle requests for creating new languages. Please note that the
    availability of choices depends on the file format, see :ref:`formats`.
Merge style
    You can configure how the updates from the upstream repository are handled.
    This might not be supported for some VCS. See :ref:`merge-rebase` for
    more details.
Commit message
    Message used when committing translation, see :ref:`commit-message`.
Committer name
    Name of the committer used on Weblate commits, the author will be always the
    real translator. On some VCS this might be not supported. Default value
    can be changed by :setting:`DEFAULT_COMMITER_NAME`.
Committer email
    Email of committer used on Weblate commits, the author will be always the
    real translator. On some VCS this might be not supported. Default value
    can be changed by :setting:`DEFAULT_COMMITER_EMAIL`.
Push on commit
    Whether any committed changes should be automatically pushed to upstream
    repository.
Age of changes to commit
    Configures how old changes (in hours) will be committed by
    :djadmin:`commit_pending` management command (usually executed by cron).
    Default value can be changed by :setting:`COMMIT_PENDING_HOURS`.
Language filter
    Regular expression which is used to filter translation when scanning for
    file mask. This can be used to limit list of languages managed by Weblate
    (eg. ``^(cs|de|es)$`` will include only those there languages. Please note
    that you need to list language codes as they appear in the filename.

.. note::

    Most of the fields can be edited by project owners or managers in the 
    Weblate interface.

.. _commit-message:

Commit message formatting
+++++++++++++++++++++++++

The commit message on each commit Weblate does, it can use following format
strings in the message:

``%(language)s``
    Language code
``%(language_name)s``
    Language name
``%(component)s``
    Component name
``%(project)s``
    Project name
``%(url)s``
    Translation URL
``%(total)s``
    Total strings count
``%(fuzzy)s``
    Count of strings needing review
``%(fuzzy_percent)s``
    Percent of strings needing review
``%(translated)s``
    Translated strings count
``%(translated_percent)s``
    Translated strings percent

.. _import-speed:

Importing speed
---------------

Fetching VCS repository and importing translations to Weblate can be a lengthy
process depending on size of your translations. Here are some tips to improve
this situation:

Clone Git repository in advance
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

You can put in place a Git repository which will be used by Weblate. The
repositories are stored in :file:`vcs` directory in path defined by
:setting:`DATA_DIR` in :file:`settings.py` in :file:`<project>/<component>`
directories.

This can be especially useful if you already have local clone of this
repository and you can use ``--reference`` option while cloning:

.. code-block:: sh

    git clone \
        --reference /path/to/checkout \
        https://github.com/WeblateOrg/weblate.git \
        weblate/repos/project/component

Optimize configuration
++++++++++++++++++++++

The default configuration is useful for testing and debugging Weblate, while
for production setup, you should do some adjustments. Many of them have quite
a big impact on performance. Please check :ref:`production` for more details,
especially:

* :ref:`production-indexing`
* :ref:`production-cache`
* :ref:`production-database`
* :ref:`production-debug`

Disable not needed checks
+++++++++++++++++++++++++

Some quality checks can be quite expensive and if you don't need them, they
can save you some time during import. See :setting:`CHECK_LIST` for more
information how to configure this.

.. _autocreate:

Automatic creation of components
--------------------------------

In case you have project with dozen of translation files, you might want to
import them automatically. This can be either achieved from command line using
:djadmin:`import_project` or :djadmin:`import_json` or by installing
:ref:`addon-weblate.discovery.discovery` addon.

For using the addon, you need to first create component for one translation
file (choose the one that is least likely to be renamed or removed in future)
and install the addon on this component.

For the management commans, you need to create a project which will contain all
components and then it's just a matter of running :djadmin:`import_project` or
:djadmin:`import_json`.

.. seealso:: 
   
   :ref:`manage`,
   :ref:`addon-weblate.discovery.discovery`

.. _fulltext:

Fulltext search
---------------

Fulltext search is based on Whoosh. You can either allow Weblate to directly
update the index on every change to content or offload this to separate process by
:setting:`OFFLOAD_INDEXING`.

The first approach (immediate updates) allows for a more up to date index, but
suffers locking issues in some setups (eg. Apache's mod_wsgi) and produces a more
fragmented index.

Offloaded indexing is always the better choice for production setup - it only marks
which items need to be reindexed and you need to schedule a background process
(:djadmin:`update_index`) to update index. This leads to a faster response of the
site and less fragmented index with the cost that it might be slightly outdated.

   :djadmin:`update_index`, :setting:`OFFLOAD_INDEXING`, :ref:`faq-ft-slow`, :ref:`faq-ft-lock`, :ref:`faq-ft-space`
