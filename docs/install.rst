Requirements on Debian or Ubuntu
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

On Debian or Ubuntu, all requirements are already packaged, to install them you can use apt-get:

.. code-block:: sh

    apt-get install python-django translate-toolkit python-git python-django-registration \
        python-whoosh python-cairo python-gtk2 python-django-south

    # Optional for database backend

    apt-get install python-mysqldb   # For MySQL
    apt-get install python-psycopg2  # For PostgreSQL

Requirements on openSUSE
++++++++++++++++++++++++

All requirements are available either directly in openSUSE or in
``devel:languages:python`` repository:

.. code-block:: sh

    zypper install python-django python-django-registration translate-toolkit python-GitPython \
        python-whoosh python-cairo python-South python-gtk


Requirements on OSX
++++++++++++++++++++++++

PyCairo and PyGtk are available to be installed using brew, all other requirements
must be installed using pip as explained next. In a terminal:

.. code-block:: sh

    brew update
    brew install py2cairo pygtk

If your python was not installed using brew, make sure you have this in
your .bash_profile file or executed somehow:

.. code-block:: sh

    export PYTHONPATH="/usr/local/lib/python2.7/site-packages:$PYTHONPATH"

This configuration make available the installed libraries to python


Requirements using pip installer
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Most requirements can be also installed using pip installer:

.. code-block:: sh

    pip install -r requirements.txt

However you need to get PyCairo and PyGtk for your platform elsewhere as they
do not support this easy installation method. Check their website for options
for getting appropriate binaries.

.. _installation:

Installation
------------

Copy :file:`weblate/settings_example.py` to :file:`weblate/settings.py` and
adjust it to match your setup. You will probably want to adjust following
options:

``ADMINS``

    List of site administrators to receive notifications when something goes
    wrong, for example notifications on failed merge or Django errors.

    .. seealso:: https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.4/ref/settings/#admins

``DATABASES``

    Connectivity to database server, please check Django's documentation for more
    details.

    .. note::

        When using MySQL, don't forget to create database with UTF-8 encoding:

        .. code-block:: sql

            CREATE DATABASE <dbname> CHARACTER SET utf8;

    .. seealso:: https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.4/ref/settings/#databases, https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.4/ref/databases/

``DEBUG``

    Disable this for production server. With debug mode enabled, Django will
    show backtraces in case of error to users, when you disable it, errors will
    go by email to ``ADMINS`` (see above).

    Debug mode also slows down Weblate as Django stores much more information
    internally in this case.

    .. seealso:: https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.4/ref/settings/#debug

``DEFAULT_FROM_EMAIL``

    Email sender address for outgoing email, for example registration emails.

    .. seealso:: `DEFAULT_FROM_EMAIL documentation`_

``SERVER_EMAIL``

    Email used as sender address for sending emails to administrator, for
    example notifications on failed merge.

    .. seealso:: `SERVER_EMAIL documentation`_

After your configuration is ready, you can run :program:`./manage.py syncdb` and 
:program:`./manage.py migrate` to create database structure. Now you should be
able to create translation projects using admin interface.

In case you want to run installation non interactively, you can use 
:program:`./manage.py syncdb --noinput` and then create admin user using 
:djadmin:`createadmin` command.

You should also login to admin interface (on ``/admin/`` URL) and adjust
default site name to match your domain.

.. note::

    If you are running version from Git, you should also regenerate locale
    files every time you are upgrading. You can do this by invoking script
    :file:`./scripts/generate-locales`.

.. seealso:: :ref:`config`, :ref:`privileges`, :ref:`faq-site`

Production setup
----------------

For production setup you should do following adjustments:

.. _production-debug:

Disable debug mode
++++++++++++++++++

Disable Django's debug mode by:

.. code-block:: python

    DEBUG = False

With debug mode Django stores all executed queries and shows users backtrackes
of errors what is not desired in production setup.

.. seealso:: :ref:`installation`

.. _production-admins:

Properly configure admins
+++++++++++++++++++++++++

Set correct admin addresses to ``ADMINS`` setting for defining who will receive
mail in case something goes wrong on the server, for example:

.. code-block:: python

    ADMINS = (
        ('Your Name', 'your_email@example.com'),
    )

.. seealso:: :ref:`installation`

.. _production-site:

Set correct site name
+++++++++++++++++++++

Adjust site name in admin interface, otherwise links in RSS or registration
emails will not work.

.. seealso:: :ref:`faq-site`

.. _production-indexing:

Enable indexing offloading
++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Enable :setting:`OFFLOAD_INDEXING` to prevent locking issues and improve
performance.

.. seealso:: :ref:`fulltext`, :setting:`OFFLOAD_INDEXING`

.. _production-database:

Use powerful database engine
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Use powerful database engine (SQLite is usually not good enough for production
environment), for example setup for MySQL:

.. code-block:: python

    DATABASES = {
        'default': {
            'ENGINE': 'django.db.backends.mysql',
            'NAME': 'weblate',
            'USER': 'weblate',
            'PASSWORD': 'weblate',
            'HOST': '127.0.0.1',
            'PORT': '',
        }
    }

.. seealso:: :ref:`installation`, `Django's databases <https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.4/ref/databases/>`_

.. _production-cache:

Enable caching
++++++++++++++

If possible, use memcache from Django by adjusting ``CACHES`` config variable,
for example:

.. code-block:: python

    CACHES = {
        'default': {
            'BACKEND': 'django.core.cache.backends.memcached.MemcachedCache',
            'LOCATION': '127.0.0.1:11211',
        }
    }

.. seealso:: `Djangoâ€™s cache framework <https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.4/topics/cache/>`_

.. _production-email:

Configure email addresses
+++++++++++++++++++++++++

Weblate needs to send out emails on several occasions and these emails should
have correct sender address, please configure ``SERVER_EMAIL`` and
``DEFAULT_FROM_EMAIL`` to match your environment, for example:

.. code-block:: python

    SERVER_EMAIL = 'admin@example.org'
    DEFAULT_FROM_EMAIL = 'weblate@example.org'

.. seealso:: 
    :ref:`installation`, 
    `DEFAULT_FROM_EMAIL documentation`_,
    `SERVER_EMAIL documentation`_

.. _DEFAULT_FROM_EMAIL documentation: https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.4/ref/settings/#default-from-email
.. _SERVER_EMAIL documentation: https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.4/ref/settings/#server-email

.. _server:

Running server
--------------

Running Weblate is not different from running any other Django based
application.

It is recommended to serve static files directly by your web server, you should
use that for following paths:

:file:`/media`
    Serves :file:`media` directory from Weblate.
:file:`/static/admin`
    Serves media files for Django admin interface (eg.
    :file:`/usr/share/pyshared/django/contrib/admin/media/`).

Additionally you should setup rewrite rule to serve :file:`media/favicon.ico`
as :file:`favicon.ico`.

.. seealso:: https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.4/howto/deployment/

Sample configuration for Lighttpd
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

The configuration for Lighttpd web server might look like following (available
as :file:`examples/lighttpd.conf`):

.. literalinclude:: ../examples/lighttpd.conf

Sample configuration for Apache
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Following configuration runs Weblate as WSGI, you need to have enabled
mod_wsgi (available as :file:`examples/apache.conf`):

.. literalinclude:: ../examples/apache.conf

Running Weblate under path
++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Minimalistic configuration to serve Weblate under /weblate (you will need to
include portions of above full configuration to allow access to the files). Again
using mod_wsgi (also available as :file:`examples/apache-path.conf`):

.. literalinclude:: ../examples/apache-path.conf

Additionally you will have to adjust :file:`weblate/settings.py`::

    URL_PREFIX = '/weblate'

.. note:: This is supported since Weblate 1.3.

.. _appliance:

Prebuilt appliance
------------------

Prebuilt appliance provides preconfigured Weblate running with MySQL database
as backend and Apache as web server. However it comes with standard set of
passwords you will want to change:

======== ======== ======= ==================================================
Username Password Scope   Description
======== ======== ======= ==================================================
root     linux    System  Administrator account, use for local or SSH login
root              MySQL   MySQL administrator
weblate  weblate  MySQL   Account in MySQL database for storing Weblate data
admin    admin    Weblate Weblate/Django admin user
======== ======== ======= ==================================================

The appliance is built using SUSE Studio and is based on openSUSE 12.2.

You should also adjust some settings to match your environment, namely:

* :ref:`production-debug`
* :ref:`production-site`
* :ref:`production-email`

Upgrading
---------

.. _generic-upgrade-instructions:

Generic upgrade instructions
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

.. versionchanged:: 1.2
    Since version 1.2 the migration is done using South module, to upgrade to 1.2, 
    please see :ref:`version-specific-instructions`.

Before upgrading, please check current :ref:`requirements` as they might have
changed.

To upgrade database structure, you should run following commands:

.. code-block:: sh

    ./manage.py syncdb
    ./manage.py migrate

To upgrade default set of privileges definitions (optional), run:

.. code-block:: sh

    ./manage.py setupgroups

To upgrade default set of language definitions (optional), run:

.. code-block:: sh

    ./manage.py setuplang

.. _version-specific-instructions:

Version specific instructions
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Upgrade from 0.5 to 0.6
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

On upgrade to version 0.6 you should run :program:`./manage.py syncdb` and
:program:`./manage.py setupgroups --move` to setup access control as described
in installation section.

Upgrade from 0.6 to 0.7
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

On upgrade to version 0.7 you should run :program:`./manage.py syncdb` to
setup new tables and :program:`./manage.py rebuild_index` to build index for
fulltext search.

Upgrade from 0.7 to 0.8
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

On upgrade to version 0.8 you should run :program:`./manage.py syncdb` to setup
new tables, :program:`./manage.py setupgroups` to update privileges setup and
:program:`./manage.py rebuild_index` to rebuild index for fulltext search.

Upgrade from 0.8 to 0.9
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

On upgrade to version 0.9 file structure has changed. You need to move
:file:`repos` and :file:`whoosh-index` to :file:`weblate` folder. Also running
:program:`./manage.py syncdb`, :program:`./manage.py setupgroups` and
:program:`./manage.py setuplang` is recommended to get latest updates of 
privileges and language definitions.

Upgrade from 0.9 to 1.0
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

On upgrade to version 1.0 one field has been added to database, you need to
invoke following SQL command to adjust it:

.. code-block:: sql

    ALTER TABLE `trans_subproject` ADD `template` VARCHAR(200);

Upgrade from 1.0 (1.1) to 1.2
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

On upgrade to version 1.2, the migration procedure has changed. It now uses
South for migrating database. To switch to this new migration schema, you need
to run following commands:

.. code-block:: sh

    ./manage.py syncdb
    ./manage.py migrate trans 0001 --fake
    ./manage.py migrate accounts 0001 --fake
    ./manage.py migrate lang 0001 --fake

Also please note that there are several new requirements and version 0.8 of
django-registration is now being required, see :ref:`requirements` for more
details.

Once you have done this, you can use :ref:`generic-upgrade-instructions`.

Upgrade from 1.2 to 1.3
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Since 1.3, :file:`settings.py` is not shipped with Weblate, but only example
settings as :file:`settings_example.py` it is recommended to use it as new base
for your setup.

Upgrade from 1.4 to 1.5
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Several internal modules and paths have been renamed and changed, please adjust
your :file:`settings.py` to match that (consult :file:`settings_example.py` for
correct values).

* Many modules lost their `weblate.` prefix.
* Checks were moved to submodules.
* Locales were moved to top level directory.

Migrating from Pootle
---------------------

As Weblate was originally written as replacement from Pootle, it is supported
to migrate user accounts from Pootle. All you need to do is to copy
``auth_user`` table from Pootle, user profiles will be automatically created
for users as they log in and they will be asked to update their settings.
