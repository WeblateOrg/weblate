Contributing
============

There are dozens of ways to contribute in Weblate. We welcome any help, be it
coding help, graphics design, documentation or sponsorship.

Code and development
--------------------

Weblate is being developed on `GitHub <https://github.com/WeblateOrg/weblate>`_. You
are welcome to fork the code and open pull requests. Patches in any other form
are welcome as well.

    Check out :ref:`internals` to see how Weblate looks from inside.

Coding standard
---------------

The code should follow PEP-8 coding guidelines.

It is good idea to check your contributions using :program:`pep8`,
:program:`pylint` and :program:`pyflages`. You can execute all checks
by script :file:`ci/run-lint`.

Testsuite
---------

We do write testsuite for our code, so please add testcases for any new
functionality and verify that it works. You can see current test results on
`Travis <https://travis-ci.org/WeblateOrg/weblate>`_ and coverage on `Codecov <https://codecov.io/github/WeblateOrg/weblate>`_.

To run testsuite locally, use:

.. code-block:: sh

    DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE=weblate.settings_test ./manage.py test

You can also specify individual tests to run:

.. code-block:: sh

    DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE=weblate.settings_test ./manage.py test weblate.gitexport

.. seealso::

    See :doc:`django:topics/testing/index` for more info on running and
    writing tests for Django.

Reporting issues
----------------

Our `issue tracker <https://github.com/WeblateOrg/weblate/issues>`_ is hosted at GitHub:

Feel welcome to report any issues with or suggest improvement of Weblate there.
In case you have found a security issue in Weblate, please consult the "Security
issues" section below.

Security issues
---------------

In order to give the community time to respond and upgrade we strongly urge you
report all security issues privately. We're currently using HackerOne to handle
security issues, so you are welcome to report issues directly at `HackerOne <https://hackerone.com/weblate>`_.

Alternatively you can report them to security@weblate.org, which ends up on
HackerOne as well.

If you don't want to use HackerOne, for whatever reason, you can send the report
by email to michal@cihar.com. You can choose to encrypt it using his PGP key
`3CB 1DF1 EF12 CF2A C0EE  5A32 9C27 B313 42B7 511D`.

.. note::

    We're heavily depending on third party components for many things.  In case
    you find a vulnerability which is affecting those components in general,
    please report it directly to them.

    Some of these are:

    * :doc:`Django <django:internals/security>`
    * `Django REST framework <https://www.django-rest-framework.org/#security>`_
    * `Python Social Auth <https://github.com/python-social-auth>`_

Starting with our codebase

If you have Docker and docker-compose installed you can spin up the development
environment simply by running:

.. code-block:: sh
