Usage guide
===========

This document briefly covers how to translate application using Weblate.

Registration
------------

While everybody can browse projects, view translations or suggest them, only
registered users are allowed to actually save changes and are credited for
every translation made.

You can register following two simple steps:

1. Fill out the registration form with your credentials
2. Activate registration by following in email you receive
3. Possibly adjust your profile to choose which languages you know

User profile
------------

User profile contains your preferences, name and email. Name and email
are being used in Git commits, so keep this information accurate.

Languages
+++++++++

Choose here which languages you prefer to translate. These will be offered to
you on main page to have easier access to translations.

Secondary languages
+++++++++++++++++++

You can define secondary languages, which will be shown you while translating
together with source language. Example can be seen on following image, where
Czech language is shown as secondary:

.. image:: _static/secondary-language.png

Projects structure
------------------

Each project can contain various subprojects. The reason for this structure is
that all subprojects in a project are expected to have a lot in common.
Whenever translation is made in single subproject, it is automatically
propagated to others within same project (this is especially useful when
translating more version of same project).

Translation links
-----------------

Once you navigate to translation, you will be shown set of links which lead to
translation. These are results of various checks, like untranslated or fuzzy
strings. Should no other checks fire, there will be still link to all
translations. Alternatively you can use search field to find translation you
need to fix.

Translating
-----------

On translate page, you are shown source string and edit area for translating.
Should the translation be plural, multiple source strings and edit areas are
shown, each described with label for plural form.

Any special whitespace chars are underlined in red and indicated with grey
symbols. Also more than one space is underlined in red to allow translator to
keep formatting.

There are various extra information which can be shown on this page. Most of
them are coming from the project source code (like context, comments or where
the message is being used). When you configure secondary languages in your
preferences, translation to these languages will be shown.

Bellow translation can be also shown suggestions from other users, which you
can accept or delete.

Translation context
+++++++++++++++++++

Translation context part allows you to see related information about current
string.

Nearby messages
    Displays messages which are located nearby in translation file. These
    usually are also used in similar context and you might want to check them
    to keep translation consistent.
Similar messages
    Messages which are similar to currently one, which again can help you to
    stay consistent within translation.
All locations
    In case message appears in multiple places (eg. multiple subprojects),
    this tab shows all of them and for inconsistent translations (see
    :ref:`check-inconsistent`) you can choose which one to use.
Dictionary
    Displays words from project dictionary which are used in current message.
Recent edits
    List of people who have changed this message recently using Weblate.
Project
    Project information like instructions for translators or information about
    Git repository.

Dictionary
----------

Each project can have assigned dictionary for any language. This could be used
for storing terminology for given project, so that translations are consistent.
You can display terms from currently translated string in bottom tabs.

Suggestions
-----------

As an anonymous user, you have no other choice than making a suggestion.
However if you are logged in you can still decide to make only a suggestion
instead of saving translation, for example in case you are unsure about the
translation and you want somebody else to review it.
