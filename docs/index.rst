  .. note::

     This documentation is translated from the `original English one
     <https://docs.weblate.org/en/latest/>`_ by community members on
     `Hosted Weblate <https://hosted.weblate.org/projects/weblate/documentation/>`_.

     Depending on the translation effort's completion level, you may find
     paragraphs or whole pages which are still in English. You can help the
     community by providing new translations or reviewing existing ones on
     Weblate.
