Weblate Trademark Guidelines
============================

Weblate is an open-source organization. Because we make privacy-respecting localization tools and provide it as copylefted libre software, proper use of our trademarks is essential to inform users whether Weblate stands behind a product or service so that we can continue to develop. The Weblate name is not only a trademark used to identify our technology, components and services, it also serves as our company name. When using Weblate trademarks (including some product names that are part of our organization) you must comply with these Weblate Trademark Guidelines.

Some of our trademarks include:

However, this is not a complete list of our names, logos, and brand features, all of which are subject to these guidelines.

When do I need specific permission to use a Weblate trademark?
--------------------------------------------------------------

Since Weblate is a provider of a software that can be used in many versions – hosted, dedicated cloud and self-hosted (both paid and free), it is important to distinguish between these cases. Each version has a specific way of using the Weblate trademark. However, in all cases it is not necessary to receive permission directly from Weblate (or its affiliates) to:

* Use Weblate wordmarks and/or logos in unmodified versions of Weblate programs, products, services and technologies.
* Use Weblate wordmarks in text to truthfully refer to and/or link to unmodified Weblate programs, products, services and technologies.
* Use Weblate logos in visuals to truthfully refer to and/or to link to the applicable programs, products, services and technologies hosted on Weblate servers.
* Use Weblate wordmarks to explain that your software is based on Weblate's open-source code or is compatible with Weblate's software.
* Describe a social media account, page, or community in accordance with the Social Media Guidelines.

All other uses of a Weblate trademark require our prior written permission. This includes any use of a Weblate trademark in a domain name.

When allowed, how should I use a Weblate trademark?
---------------------------------------------------

General Guidelines
++++++++++++++++++

**Do:**

* Use the Weblate trademark exactly as shown in the list above.
* Use Weblate wordmarks only as a noun. Avoid Adjectives and Verbs. Do not use them in plural.

**Don't:**

* Don't use Weblate trademarks in the name of your business, product, service, app, domain name, publication, or other offering.
* Don't use marks, logos, company names, slogans, domain names, or designs that are confusingly like Weblate trademarks.
* Don't use Weblate trademarks in a way that incorrectly implies affiliation with, or sponsorship, endorsement, or approval by Weblate of your products or services.
* Don't display Weblate trademarks more prominently than your product, service, or company name.
* Don't use Weblate trademarks on merchandise for sale (e.g., selling t-shirts, mugs, etc.).
* Don't use Weblate trademarks for any other form of commercial use (e.g. offering technical support services).
* Don't modify Weblate's trademarks, abbreviate them, or combine them with any other symbols, words, or images, or incorporate them into a tagline or slogan.

Social Media Guidelines
+++++++++++++++++++++++

In addition to the General Guidelines above, the name and handle of your social media account and all pages cannot begin with an Weblate trademark. In addition, Weblate logos cannot be used in a way that might suggest affiliation with Weblate, including, but not limited to, the account, profile, or header images. The only exception to these requirements is if you've received prior permission from Weblate.

For example, you cannot name your account, page, or community "Weblate Representatives" or "Weblate Software". However, it would be acceptable to name your account, page, or community "Fans of Weblate" or "Information about Weblate Software" if you do not use the Weblate trademarks or Weblate logos or otherwise suggest any affiliation with Weblate.

Open-Source Project Guidelines
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

The specific license for each of Weblate's software products and code says what you can and cannot do with the code itself but does not give permission to use Weblate's trademarks. If you choose to build on or modify Weblate's open-source code for your own project,

**You Must:**

* Follow the terms of the Open-Source License(s) for Weblate software products and code (mainly GPLv3).
* Choose branding, logos, and trademarks that denotes your own unique identity to clearly signal to users that there is no affiliation with or endorsement by Weblate.
* Follow the General Guidelines, above.

**You Must NOT:**

* Use any Weblate trademark in connection with the user-facing name or branding of your project.
* Use any Weblate trademark or any part of any Weblate trademark to incorrectly suggest or give the impression your software is published by, affiliated with, or endorsed by Weblate.

For example, please do not name your project, [Something]-Weblate, or Weblate-[Something]

**You May:**

* State in words (not using logos or images) that your product "works with" or "is compatible" with certain Weblate products, if that is true.
* State in words (not using logos or images) that your project is based on Weblate open-source technology, if that is true, if you also include a statement that your project is not officially associated with Weblate or its products.

For instance, you may state that your project:

"is proudly built from Weblate's open-source software"

as long as you also include the statement equally prominently:

"[Brand Name] and [Product Name] are not officially associated with Weblate or its products."

Weblate Community Guidelines
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Various permissions to use Weblate Trademarks have been provided to various members of the Weblate Community, and these Weblate Trademark Guidelines do not alter any such previously granted permissions.
