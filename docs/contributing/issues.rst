Security issues
---------------

Weblate’s development team is strongly committed to responsible reporting and
disclosure of security-related issues. We have adopted and follow policies that
are geared toward delivering timely security updates to Weblate.

Most normal bugs in Weblate are reported to our public `GitHub issues tracker
<https://github.com/WeblateOrg/weblate/issues>`_, but due to the sensitive
nature of security issues, we ask that they not be publicly reported in this
fashion.

Instead, if you believe you’ve found something in Weblate that has security
implications, please submit a description of the issue to security@weblate.org
or using `HackerOne <https://hackerone.com/weblate>`_.

A member of the security team will respond to you within 48 hours, and
depending on what action is taken, you may get more follow-up emails.

.. note::

   **Sending encrypted reports**

   If you want to send an encrypted email (*optional*), please use the public
   key  for michal@weblate.org with ID ``3CB 1DF1 EF12 CF2A C0EE  5A32 9C27 B313
   42B7 511D``. This public key is available on the most commonly used key servers,
   and from  `Keybase <https://keybase.io/nijel>`_.

.. hint::

    Weblate depends on third-party components for many things. In case
    you find a vulnerability affecting one of those components in general,
    please report it directly to the respective project.

    Some of these are:

    * :doc:`Django <django:internals/security>`
    * `Django REST framework <https://www.django-rest-framework.org/#security>`_
    * `Python Social Auth <https://github.com/python-social-auth>`_
