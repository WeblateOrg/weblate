Weblate frontend
================

The frontend is currently built using Bootstrap, jQuery and few third party libraries.

Supported browsers
------------------

Weblate supports the latest, stable releases of all major browsers and
platforms.

Alternative browsers which use the latest version of WebKit, Blink, or Gecko,
whether directly or via the platformâ€™s web view API, are not explicitly
supported. However, Weblate should (in most cases) display and function
correctly in these browsers as well.

Older browsers might work, but some features might be limited.

Dependency management
---------------------

The yarn package manager is used to update third party libraries. The
configuration lives in :file:`scripts/yarn` and there is a wrapper script
:file:`scripts/yarn-update` to upgrade the libraries, build them and copy to
correct locations in :file:`weblate/static/vendor`, where all third partly
frontend code is located. The Weblate specific code should be placed directly
in :file:`weblate/static` or feature specific subdirectories (for example
:file:`weblate/static/editor`).

Adding new third-party library typically consists of:

.. code-block:: sh

   # Add a yarn package
   yarn --cwd scripts/yarn add PACKAGE
   # Edit the script to copy package to the static folder
   edit scripts/yarn-update
   # Run the update script
   ./scripts/yarn-update
   # Add files to git
   git add .

Coding style
------------

Weblate relies on `Prettier`_ for the code formatting for both JavaScript and CSS files.

We also use `ESLint`_ to check the JavaScript code.

.. _Prettier: https://prettier.io/


Localization
------------

Should you need any user visible text in the frontend code, it should be
localizable. In most cases all you need is to wrap your text inside ``gettext``
function, but there are more complex features available:

.. code-block:: javascript

    document.write(gettext('this is to be translated'));

    var object_count = 1 // or 0, or 2, or 3, ...
    s = ngettext('literal for the singular case',
            'literal for the plural case', object_count);

    fmts = ngettext('There is %s object. Remaining: %s',
            'There are %s objects. Remaining: %s', 11);
    s = interpolate(fmts, [11, 20]);
    // s is 'There are 11 objects. Remaining: 20'

Icons
-----

Weblate currently uses material design icons. In case you are looking for new
symbol, check `Material Design Icons`_ or `Material Design Resources`_.

Additionally, there is :file:`scripts/optimize-svg` to reduce size of the SVG
as most of the icons are embedded inside the HTML to allow styling of the
paths.
