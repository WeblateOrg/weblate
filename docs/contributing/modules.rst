Contributing to Weblate modules
===============================

Besides the main repository, Weblate consists of several Python modules. All
these follow same structure and this documentation covers them all.

For example, this covers:

* `wlc <https://github.com/WeblateOrg/wlc/>`_, Python client library, see :ref:`wlc`
* `translation-finder <https://github.com/WeblateOrg/translation-finder/>`_, used to discover translatable files in the repository
* `language-data <https://github.com/WeblateOrg/language-data/>`_, language definitions for Weblate, see :ref:`languages`
