.. _translating-weblate:

Translating Weblate
-------------------

Weblate is continually being `translated <https://hosted.weblate.org/>`_ using Weblate itself. Feel
free to take your part in the effort of making Weblate available in as many human languages
as possible. It brings Weblate closer to its users!

If you find a possible mistake in the source string, you can mark it with a comment in the Weblate editor.
This way, it can be discussed and corrected. If you’re certain, you can also click on the link in the
:guilabel:`Source string location` section and submit a PR with your correction.
