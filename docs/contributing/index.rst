Contributing to Weblate
=======================

Language
--------

`Translate <https://hosted.weblate.org/projects/weblate/>`_ Weblate itself,
and point out errors in source strings while you do. Suggest source string changes, or
click "Source string location" in the lower right of the regular editor to have
a go yourself.

Here in the documentation, click :guilabel:`Edit on GitHub` atop the page to do the same thing.
`Open an issue https://github.com/WeblateOrg/weblate/issues/new?assignees=comradekingu&labels=ux&template=bug_report.md>`_
if you know something is wrong or have an issue with the documentation, but not how to fix it.
Remove the template stuff; a link and description will do.
