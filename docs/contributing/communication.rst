Weblate Contributor Communication Guidelines
============================================

GitHub Issues
-------------
`GitHub Issues <https://github.com/WeblateOrg/weblate/issues>`_ is where bugs can be reported, and features can be requested.
Issue submission form provides templates for each to simplify issue creation, and review and implementation process;
it also guides to other places with information like documentation, Discussions, HackerOne program, and Weblate Care.

Weblate GitHub Discussions
--------------------------
`GitHub Discussions <https://github.com/WeblateOrg/weblate/discussions>`_ is a community place.
Ideas, Polls, Q&A, and Show and Tell categories can be selected when posting there.
General category fits all posts outside those defined categories. Weblate team members occasionally
visit Discussions and can also be mentioned by their GitHub usernames.

Weblate on Mastodon
-------------------
If you want to attract a wide community of Weblate users, fans, and developers to your case, you can follow and mention `@weblate@fosstodon.org <https://fosstodon.org/@weblate>`_ on Mastodon. The Weblate team boosts good moods and bright ideas!

Libera.Chat
-----------
`Libera.Chat <https://web.libera.chat/#weblate>`_ is an IRC network for FOSS projects. It can be used to informally ask basic
questions or start conversations of the community there. This platform can be thought of as being similar to in person communication,
where only the people who are currently in the room (channel) are likely to respond to your message.

No account is required; users can enter the chat by specifying a nickname or as a guest by default.
