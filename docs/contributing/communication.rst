Weblate Contributer Communication Guidelines
============================================

GitHub Discussions
------------------
`GitHub Discussions <https://github.com/WeblateOrg/weblate/discussions>`_
should be used for all forms of communication that pertain to any one of the following categories: Ideas, Polls, Q&A,
Show and Tell. Any one of these categories can be selected when making a post in Weblate's GitHub Discussions page.
There is also a General category that can be selected for posts that do not fit within any one of the defined categories,
but are too targeted or formal to be included in Libera.Chat. Questions about particular Issues can also be included here, but
complicated problems pertaining to configuration or deployment should follow the "Support question" template in GitHub Issues.

GitHub Issues
-------------
`GitHub Issues <https://github.com/WeblateOrg/weblate/issues>`_ is where bugs can be reported, features can be requested, and
in-depth configuration or deployment questions can be asked. Weblate provides individual templates for each one of these items
to simplify Issue creation and review. As noted in the GitHub Discussions section above, questions about particular Issues can be
included in GitHub Discussions, but discussion or clarification about the nature of Issues should be included as comments beneath
the particular issue in question.

Questions or comments about Issues posted in GitHub Discussions should pertain to problems that arise when implementing the
solution to the Issue, whereas questions or comments that are related to providing additional clarification for the nature of
the Issues themselves should be included as Issue comments. The one exception to this is when a contributor is has an in-depth
support question that deals with configuration or deployment. These types of questions should follow the provided
"Support question" template in Github Issues unless they are simple enough to be included in GitHub Discussions.

Libera.Chat
-----------
`Libera.Chat <https://web.libera.chat/#weblate>`_ is an IRC network for FOSS project that can be used to informally ask basic
questions or start conversations that do  not pertain to a particular GitHub Issue. This platform should be thought of as being
similar to in person communication, where only the people who are currently in the channel are likely to respond to your message.
This form of communication should be thought of as the least formal and least targeted, and should only be used when posting in
GitHub Discussions or GitHub Issues would not be advised per the guidelines above. No account is required; users can enter the
chat by specifying a nickname or as a guest by default.
