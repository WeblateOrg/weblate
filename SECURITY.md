# Weblate security

The Weblate team takes security and related transparency very seriously.
We welcome any peer review of our 100% open-source code to ensure nobody's Weblate
is ever compromised or hacked.

Information about practices for reporting and fixing security issues is described
in [our documentation][1] and on [our page at HackerOne][2]. This ensures all
vulnerabilities are solved securely, quickly, and transparently.
