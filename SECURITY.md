# Weblate security

The Weblate team takes security and related transparency very seriously.
We welcome any peer review of our 100% open-source code to ensure nobody's Weblate
is ever compromised or hacked.

If you think you have identified a security issue with a Weblate project, **do
not open a public issue**.

To responsibly report a security issue, please navigate to the Security tab for
the repository and click “Report a vulnerability”.

Be sure to include as much detail as necessary in your report. As with
reporting normal issues, a minimal reproducible example will help the
maintainers address the issue faster.

More information about practices for reporting and fixing security issues is
described in [our documentation][1]. This ensures all vulnerabilities are
solved securely, quickly, and transparently.
