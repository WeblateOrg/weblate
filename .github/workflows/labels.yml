          This issue has been added to the backlog. It is not scheduled
          on the Weblate roadmap, but it eventually might be implemented.

          This issue has been put aside. It is currently unclear if it will
          ever be implemented as it seems to cover too narrow of a use case
          or doesn't seem to fit into Weblate.


          Please try to clarify the use case or consider proposing something more generic to make it useful to more users.

          This issue looks more like a support question than an
          issue. We strive to answer these reasonably fast, but
          [purchasing the support subscription](https://weblate.org/support/)
          is not only more responsible and faster for your business but also makes Weblate stronger.


          In case your question is already answered, [making a donation](https://weblate.org/donate/) is the right way to say thank you!
